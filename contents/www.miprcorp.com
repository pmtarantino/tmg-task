Top 5 Industrial Uses for a Cleated Conveyor Belt
FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail
If you’re in the business of getting the job done quickly and efficiently – and let’s be honest, who isn’t – then you’re going to want to look into cleated conveyor belts.
Cleated conveyor belts are especially advantageous when they’re used in industries like agriculture, mining, logistics or food and beverage. By improving grip with intuitively designed cleats, operators can create separation on the line, navigate inclines and improve the accuracy and performance of the belt.
Narrowing down the top uses for cleated conveyors isn’t easy, but you can’t go wrong incorporating them in the following industries:
1. Agriculture Cleated Conveyor Belts
Whether it’s potatoes, blueberries or any other types of crops, agriculture conveyors feature prominently in the farming process from the soil surface to up into the truck. Anyone in the industry knows that from harvesting to processing, life is much easier when machinery is involved.
Cleated conveyor belts are ideal for types of work like agriculture, where the terrain and the materials themselves could pose issues due to steep inclines or the need to separate into batches. Incorporating them at various points in the process can improve productivity – which only benefits the company in the long run, of course.
Similarly, leveraging a cleated conveyor belt with steep inclines can give processing plants that mechanical advantage they’ve been searching for. Companies can opt for more vertical designs, which saves valuable space on the floor and reduces the capital cost on the equipment.
2. Food Handling Cleated Conveyor Belts
There are a lot of different layers to the food and beverage industry, with few more important than the creation and preparation of food. Many of the products can be difficult to move efficiently at scale, even with state-of-the-art machinery.
Don’t forget that many foods are temperature sensitive and could lose their value under the wrong circumstances, like dried hops. An inability to manage temperatures effectively could have far-reaching financial effects. The worst case scenario is coming to fruition more often, with the industry now seeing food recalls rise 10 percent over the last five years, according to the Public Interest Research Group. Even one incident could devastate the bottom line and a company’s reputation.
Using a cleated conveyor belt that’s uniquely built for the type of food it’ll handle keeps operations running smoothly with foodstuff kept neatly in check and at the perfect temperature point during operation.
3. Mining and Excavation Cleated Conveyor Belts
Sand, gravel, limestone and other minerals are difficult to move through an excavation site or work site, given their often rugged layout. If walking through an area proves difficult, transporting sediment in or out of the area will only be more taxing.
By using a cleated conveyor belt, companies can significantly cut down on lost materials and better automate traditionally manual aspects of operation. Incorporating this technology can considerably improve worksite productivity, especially if it was non-existent beforehand.
At the end of the day, all materials respond differently to being handled by each design. Finding out whether a closed chevron or a U-shape design works better could make all the difference in improving the belt’s efficiency.
4. Logistics and Warehousing Cleated Conveyor Belts
The rise of eCommerce has helped logistics flourish on a massive scale, with warehouses fulfilling a key role in the success of the complex distribution that comes with an industry worth $1.6 trillion in 2018.
Automation is at the forefront of it all, with machinery playing a pivotal role in helping to achieve tight delivery deadlines. The equipment at the frontlines of moving materials and products is a critical investment, with roughly one in every 10 warehouses in the U.S. using machines that completely automate the process, according to Westernacher, a global consulting firm.
A single jam or lost parcel could bear significant costs for a company. Cleated conveyor belts ensure that items stay on track for correct distribution, maintaining peak efficiency and sustaining high productivity in light of increasing workloads.
5. Recycling Cleated Conveyor Belts
Sustainability has come to the forefront of consumers’ minds and nowhere is this being felt more than at recycling plants, with the US recycling rate up to 35 percent, according to the EPA. That’s roughly 87 million tons of material being recycled each year; or nearly 15 Great Pyramids of Giza – one of the seven Wonders of the World.
These operations deal with a massive amount of recyclables and attempting to process it all without the right equipment can lead to significant operational bottlenecks.
With a large volume of inconsistently sized materials that may have different weights, cleated conveyor belts help recycling plants keep materials in tow and operations humming along as scheduled. The custom-designed belts are a boon to efficiency, ensuring a far greater amount of recyclable material gets to its intended destination without issue thanks to uniquely fitted designs
Retrofitting equipment with patterns that are targeted to transport specific materials can improve the efficiency of legacy machinery, helping companies stave off costly capital investments.

Reducing Slip on Your Conveyor Belts
FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail
Conveyor belt slippage on its drive pulley is one of the most common conveyor belt problems and it can lead to a whole cascade of additional problems: spillage of materials, blockage of system, wear-and-tear and failure of the belt, damage or breakage to your motors, motion failure and in some cases, even injury of your employees. Slipping is not a small problem and it needs to be stopped, fast.
If your conveyor belts slip frequently you are losing time and money. What causes a conveyor belt to slip? In our 40+ years of experience, the culprits are using the wrong type of belt for the application, not getting the right amount of tension to drive between the belt, or failing to properly maintain the belt pulley environment ____ trapped materials or buildup of oils and dirt. MIPR Corp can help stop the slide. We have over 40 years of experience designing custom conveyor belt pulley solutions with the size, materials, grip, and style needed to stay on track to get the job done!
How can you keep a conveyor belt from slipping?
Get the Right Conveyor Belt…
Our engineers have seen and worked with every type of conveyor belt and can quickly determine if ongoing slippage is the fault of the belt or its installation. If your slippage is caused by a belt that is too heavy for the motors, a conveyor belt that isn’t strong enough to carry your materials, or a conveyor belt with a surface that is too slippery for the materials you are handling, you don’t need belt repair—you need a better pulley type.
MIPR Corp can help. From a tire-shredding recycling line to a large lumber sawmill to lemon, grape, and hop farms, we successfully solve slippage issues for our customers—fast.
No conveyor belt company carries the range of belt types and pulley surfaces or offers the level of customization of MIPR Corp. And we ship samples same-day so you can see, feel, and test our proposed conveyor belt pulley solutions!
Our team is always standing by to talk to you about a possible conveyor belt replacement. Before you call, read our guide to gathering the information we need to advise you on a conveyor belt replacement. By answering a few simple questions in advance you can speed up the time it takes for our team to design your optimal custom solution.
With The Right Grip…
The material and design of your conveyor belt will determine how well it conveys your production materials as well as how easily it traverses inclines and wraps pulleys. (Drive/head pulleys are usually the first place a conveyor belt will slip.) If the conveyor belt lacks the appropriate level of grip arrangements to grab and turn the belt around the pulley.
There are additional adjustments you can make during installation and calibration to stop slipping:
Install Lagging
Lagging is simply additional material added to the surface of your pulley to give it extra “grab.” The type of lagging you choose will depend on the belt type and production process so be sure to confer with the MIPR Corp engineers or check your belt’s documentation before making changes.
Adjust Tension
Proper tension on your conveyor belting will keep it on track—but don’t give into the temptation to over-tension your belt! Yes, it can seem like a clever way to solve the problem quickly, but it’s a stopgap solution at best. Over time, over-stretching the belt will strain splices and stress the motor in ways that will wear both down faster. Make your tension adjustments carefully and incrementally and give each change a few rotations before determining if it works. Remember, conveyor belts take a few turns to fully settle into their new tension settings.
Change Pulley Size or Change Out Worn Pulleys
You may have the right belt but not the right pulley. It may be that a smaller pulley was installed to save money that is now causing your belt to slip. You may also have pulleys that are worn out. MIPR Corp can help you choose a more appropriate pulley size for your conveyor belting and your line.
Add a Snub Pulley
Installed at the proper point, a snub pulley can increase the arc of contact between the belt and the pulley to increase the friction.
And The Right Care…
Even the ideal conveyor belt for the job will struggle to stay on track over time if it is not properly cared for. Regular, routine maintenance and calibration is necessary to stop conveyor belt slippage in its tracks.
Clean conveyor belts frequently
Check for signs of wear—and make repairs
Conveyor belt alignment and proper conveyor belt tracking are key to preventing conveyor belt slippage. Check out our in-depth guide on conveyor belt tracking for helpful tips on adjusting and maintaining your conveyor belt tracking.
… Stays On Track To Finish The Job On Time
Conveyor belt slippage isn’t something you have to live with! Our conveyor belting experts are on-call to help you deal with it. We create custom solutions designed for minimal downtime and maximum value and we even ship conveyor belt samples same-day!

LACING & SPLICING CONVEYOR BELTING
Selecting the correct lacing option for your belt is critical.  MIPR Corp offers a variety of lacing styles and materials to meet the needs of every application.
CUSTOM SPLICING OPTIONS:
Recessed Lace: Mechanical splice area is recessed below the belt surface.
Overflap: Mechanical lacing is installed below the belt surface and the top cover is separated from the belt carcass creating a flap over.  The cover can be glued down after installation.
Hidden Lace: Mechanical fasteners are installed below the belt cover to prevent the lace from contacting the product.
Finger Hinge Lace: Finger hinge lace is equipped with flexible, hinged plastic lacing, creating an easy, quick repair alternative to endless belts.  FHL requires the belt be made of PVC or polyurethane, have a thickness of .08″ to .263″, have a minimum belt length of 55″, and a maximum belt width of 40″.
Thermoplastic Hinge: Thermoplastic hinge lace is made with the same homogenous material as your belt.  This lace is welded to the belt and connect with a metal or nylon pin.  Nylon pins should be used when metal detectors are required. (This option is available for Volta products only.)
ENDLESS NON-MECHANICAL SPLICING SOLUTIONS
Endless splicing methods eliminate the need for hardware fasteners.  This fabrication technique is excellent for food processing and applications where products need to be handled with greater care.
Step Splice Belt: For belts with multiple plies.  Plies are separated and “stepped” to interlock with one another at the splice point.  Performed by experts in our fabrication facilities for quality assurance and appropriate curing time.
Skived Splice: A precision grinding technique is used to achieve uniform thickness at the splice point for a variety of applications.
Finger Splice: For thermoplastic, urethane and PVC belts.  A very durable splice that maintains a smooth belt surface throughout the splice area.  Multiple finger patterns are available to meet a variety of applications and system pulley sizes.
Endless-Prepared: We square and prepare the belt’s ends in our fabrication facilities for hot or cold cement bonding at the customer’s site. (Cement bonding kits with instructions are available.)
Double Finger Splice: Unlike a standard finger splice, fingers are cut from multiple plies, staggered, then fused together by heat and pressure to create a stronger, more flexible splice.
Stitched Reinforcement: Certain applications put unusual wear on splices and edges.  These areas can be strengthened with stitching.
Longitudinal Splicing: Very wide belts are created by longitudinally splicing two or more belts of narrower dimension.  Plies are expertly stepped and bonded in our fabrication facilities to create a uniformly smooth belt as wide as the application requires.  Ultra-wide belts can be made endless prior to shipping… or have ends prepared for field splicing. V-guides and other profiles can also be added.
NYLON CORE BELTING
Nylon core belts are commonly used on folder-gluer machines in the folding box industry.  Folder-gluer (“FG”) belts are antistatic with high friction, abrasion resistant NBR covers, and are non marking.  The information below shows the features and benefits.

MIPR CORP SPECIALTY BELTS
Feeder Belts – MIPR Corp manufactures a complete line of feeder belts for all of the common gravimetric and volumetric weigh feeders on the market.  Belts are available with or without flanges and bottom V-guides.  Flanges range from 1/2″ to 2″ tall and can be siped or notched for use on small diameter pulleys.  Corrugated sidewalls can be used when the feeder’s pulleys are too small for flanges or greater height is required for higher capacity feeders.  Standard feeder belts are vulcanized endless for a smooth long lasting splice.  Mechanical fasteners may also be used for quick change-outs and ease of installation.  Rubber covered “hidden” splices provide the smoothness of a vulcanized splice with the speed and ease of installation of a mechanical splice.  Many of the most common feeder belt specifications are made up in bulk rolls ready to be cut to length and spliced – greatly reducing both lead time and cost!  Flanges are available in standard 60 durometer, a softer 40 durometer for smaller pulleys and a variety of compounds to match the compound characteristics of the base belt.
Blast Cleaning Tumbling Belts – MIPR Corp’s tumbling belts for blast cleaning systems are available with a variety of hold patterns, cleat profiles and spacing.  Unique custom designs and industry standards utilize patented Thermocure bonding  process to permanently bond cleats and/or V-guides to the base belt.  A variety of cleat profiles assure the proper tumbling action.  Some of the more popular profiles include rounded, pyramid and rectangular shapes.
Magnetic Separator Belts – MIPR Corp’s magnetic separator belts revolve around a magnet suspended over a conveyor.  The magnet attracts unwanted metal from material being conveyed and pulls it to the surface of the magnetic separator belt.  With the help of rubber, urethane, or stainless steel cleats, the metal is transported out of the magnetic field and discharged into a collection area.  Magnetic separators requiring a belt are often referred to as self-cleaning and can be found in a number of industries, including coal handling, cement, recycling, food production, and many others.  These belts are available in compounds such as rubber, urethane and PVC.  MIPR Corp has more than 40 years experience in fabricating thousands of feet of magnetic separator belts.

MIPR Corp Case Study: Helping Our Customers Keep Their Harvest Season On Track
FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail
If you harvest, you know that you can’t control the weather, right? But when the right conditions present themselves, you can take advantage. Farmers, in particular, need to make the most of the warm, bright days and cool, crisp nights of the harvest season. When the crops they have tended all spring and summer finally reach the right level of ripeness, they need to pick, pack, and ship right away before damage or spoilage sets in. Any delay in the harvest production line can compromise the quality of their produce and cost them profits.
Conveyor belts are just as critical to many of today’s working farms as barns and tractors, and our farming customers count on MIPR to keep things moving smoothly during harvest season.

Installing Conveyor Belt Lacing Correctly
FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail
If you rely on conveyor belts to keep your business moving, you want that belting to last as long as possible. For over 40 years, the engineering experts at MIPR Corp. have helped customers keep their conveyor belting systems running strong—minimizing downtime and maximizing the value of their investment. Properly installing your conveyor belt lacing is a powerful way to keep your belts running as long as possible.
The most common way to install a conveyor belt on a frame is through lacing. Conveyor belt lacing works on a zipper principle. Clips, bolts, plates, hinges, or spirals made of metal or plastic are attached to both sides of separate conveyor belt segments. When pinned together properly, they “zip” the two segments of the belt into one strong, tough, smooth-running belt.

Tracking Your Conveyor Belt Correctly
FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail
If you rely on conveyor belts and the belt tracking to keep your business moving, you want that belting to last as long as possible. For over 40 years, the engineering experts at MIPR Corp. have helped customers keep their conveyor belting systems running strong—minimizing downtime and maximizing the value of their investment. Following the tracking guidelines below will help you keep your belts running as long as possible.
Think of the tires on your car or truck. (We know this is a conveyor belt blog but we promise we’re going somewhere with this!) What happens when your wheel alignment is off? When car wheels are misaligned, they do not meet the road at the proper angle. Your driving performance degrades and tires begin to wear down unevenly and much faster than they normally would—leading to potentially unsafe situations. In fact, tires wear out twice as fast when not properly aligned!

Bakery Conveyor Belts Get The Job Done
Did you know that one of the biggest challenges for bakeries today is maximizing their productivity? It’s a challenge all over the food processing industry but a small-scale, franchise or medium-sized bakery operations can struggle more than others. At these operational sizes, automation may not make financial sense, but bottlenecks can form around important tasks like kneading, oven-loading, or packing.
For your profit margins to reach their fullest potential, you need to keep your baked goods moving—and nothing does that better than high quality, food-grade conveyor belting.
Overall equipment effectiveness can be measured in many ways: quantity over time, reliability, energy consumption, personnel requirements, ease of use, and upfront and maintenance costs. Your bakery conveyor belting needs to stand up to extreme temperatures—from hot ovens to refrigeration and even freezing—while reducing ingredient spillage and waste. Your bakery belts should preserve freshness and flavors during the production and packing process and resist sticking, avoid cross-contamination (gluten, allergens, and more). And always, your bakery’s conveyor belting must keep your employees and customers safe while keeping your production line running smoothly.

CONVEYOR TERMS:
Angle of Incline – The degree a conveyor is tilted from horizontal.
Drive Pulley – Pulley connected to a power source used to drive conveyor.  Usually the drive pulley is the head pulley, but on some kinds of systems, including many package handling conveyors, the drive pulley is located underneath the conveyor.
Gravity Takeup – Device used to remove slack and stretch in a conveyor belt.  A free weight is suspended from a pulley on the return side of the belt.  The takeup is free to lower as needed to remove any slack as the belt operated.  The gravity takeup is usually located as close to the drive pulley as possible.
Head Pulley – Pulley at discharge end of belt.  The head pulley is usually powered by conveyor drive source.  Pulley “pulls” belt along the conveyor.
Return Idler – Idlers used to support the belt as it passes underneath the conveyor structure.
Roller Bed – Free-wheeling rollers on which the carrying side of the belt rides.
Screw Takeup – Device utilizing a bolt construction used to lengthen the conveyor to remove slack in the conveyor belt.  By moving a bolt, the tail pulley is pushed away from the head pulley thus removing slack from the belt.
Slider Bed – A smooth, flat surface (usually steel or wood) beneath the carrying side of the belt.
Snub Idler – Idler used to increase the amount of belt in contact with the pulley or to deflect the belt in a different direction.  Snubbing a belt near a pulley can increase the effective tension at the pulley.
Tail Pulley – Pulley at the beginning of the carrying run of the conveyor.  The tail pulley is usually free-wheeling.
Troughing Idler – Grouping of idlers on the carrying side of the conveyor deigned to make the conveyor belt curve into a cupped shape, increasing conveyor capacity.  Troughing idlers are usually 20°, 35°, or 45°.
Skirtboard Rubber – Skirtboard rubber is primarily used at the loading point to guide product into the center of the belt and to prevent spillage.

MIPR Corp experts know the grade you need to get the results you want. We can price and procure high quality used conveyor belting, deliver it and integrate it into your conveyor belt system design. To see if used conveyor belting can work for you, call MIPR Corp today.
Used conveyor belting is some of the strongest material available and It is also very abrasion resistant. It is black S.B.R., styrene butadiene rubber, the same rubber used in automotive tires. It is very ultra violet resistant, (U.V.) because it has a high carbon black component which makes it very opaque to the sun.  Carbon black also vastly increases the abrasion resistance.
Good used belt is used for any conveying situation especially suited to concrete containing rebar crushing and recycling because it is harder than new rubber. It lasts better than new conveyor belting in car crushing and sharp steel recycling because it is not as easily sliced.
Good used belting finds thousands of other uses than rock crushing and aggregate conveying. It is used to protect ships decks from steel tracked bull dozers and excavators being loaded on and off for import/export overseas operation.  It is often put down over roadways to protect road surfaces and inside of buildings to protect concrete floors from tracked equipment and snowmobiles.  Oil exploration and drilling will use belting to preserve barge and decks from heavy equipment and as chafe and damping cushions underneath drilling pipe rods and bits.  Water well drilling and fracking rigs isolate steel with used belting.
Tug boats push ships with the aid of energy absorbing cut conveyor belt layered mats surrounding the perimeter of the bow stern and gun whales. Explosive matting is utilized to contain charges put at support columns to demolish old buildings.  Demolition rubber stops flying debris.  Tractor trailer trucks use conveyor belting to form aerodynamic wind shields to become much more fuel efficient.
Used conveyor belt is used to stop erosion on sloped road and mountain roads to steer water off road surfaces and in to ditches to preserve roads from runoff. These water bars are buried and can be driven over then springing back to their original shape.  Rubber belting is used for fencing to keep animals on one side, fencing customers are big.
Livestock can be kept on one side of seasonal water courses by hanging used belt down from cables to touch the ground. The water runs underneath the created valve action but the cattle do not, keeping them on the correct property. Used conveyor belt can be formed into a troughs to feed herds of animals keeping their foods off the ground, not mixing with dirt, and dry.  In the barn, used conveyor belting is used for pigs, beef and horses to protect feet from hardness and cold.
Good used belt is a necessary part for automotive racing tracks around the world. Stacks of tires are stacked five feet high and wrapped around with heavy duty belting and bolted in place.  It is the most energy absorbing reusable combination known to mankind. Belting saves lives and makes accidents much less damaging.  The belts also disallow ricochet, stopping race cars in their tracks.
Other uses include bridge, road and airport protection. Wear pads and precision cut strips and in the fishing industry scallop drags.
In the steel industry, used conveyor belt may be rolled directly on to the soil out of doors or laid down indoors for cooling and steel roll edge protection.
MIPR Corp has sold used belting for the last 20 years. Used conveyor belting can be sold for conveyors or can be used in countless other uses.  It is also a green recycled product.  MIPR Corp can cut used conveyor belt into any size or shape.  We ship this recycled, strong product all over the USA.  From racetrack barrier to flexible fencing, customers have been extremely happy with its performance.
Used conveyor belting comes in all thickness from 3/16” to 1 ½” thick and it comes in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 ply. Some of this used conveyor belting gets installed on a conveyor system and never gets used.  When taken off the conveyor system, this new belting can be bought for half the price!

Handling Temperatures with Plastic Modular Belting
FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail
With all the current upheaval and uncertainty in food production and processing, efficiency and safety are top of mind and plastic modular conveyor belts are getting a fresh look from bakeries, meat packers, frozen food distributors, and more. Plastic modular belting has all the advantages of a synthetic belt along with its own unique superpower: the ability to withstand both high heat and freezing cold temperatures and processes in food handling conveyor belt systems. If your production line requires food-grade belting for baking and freezing, see how this FDA-approved conveyor belt can take your business to new places.
Like all synthetic modular belt conveyors, a modular plastic conveyor belt combines lightweight construction with powerful strength, flexibility, and affordability over time. Despite what you may have heard in the past, plastic modular belting now works well on small pulleys and on larger-scale structures, giving it a wider range of potential applications.
Modular Plastic Belting Stays on Track (Even in Complex Configurations)
Plastic conveyor systems run on pure positive drive. Unlike the friction drives needed by other synthetic belts, plastic modular belting utilizes low-tension drive systems. Our own MIPR Corp belting experts find plastic modular conveyor belt designs better preserve proper belt tracking—and good belt tracking is critical to your overall system performance.
Easy to run in tight curves, plastic modular conveyor belts run smoothly and consistently where other belts simply can’t. A plastic modular conveyor belt can go up and down inclines, turn multiple corners, and return to the start using only one motor and one belt. In many cases, plastic conveyor systems let MIPR Corp belting engineers create a single affordable conveyor solution for even for the most complex production lines.
So, where do plastic modular belts sometimes struggle? At very high speeds. As you push a plastic modular plastic belt conveyor faster, you can see a notable increase in noise—a real drawback in some work environments where noise levels need to be kept to a minimum. If you can run steady rather than at high speed, you can run with plastic modular belting.
Modular Plastic Belting is Easy to Clean & Repair
Because plastic conveyor systems are easy to use and install, they are also very easy to clean—and sanitization is another critical component of conveyor belt maintenance, particularly right now. Between changing FDA and USDA requirements and the current outbreak of COVID-19, everyone in food production and distribution is focused on sterilization, cleaning, and maintenance to avoid cross-contamination or infection. (Some types of plastic can react to certain industrial, high strength chemical cleaning agents, so check your plastic modular belting manufacturer standards before implementing a new cleaning or sterilization protocol.)
And should your modular plastic belt ever break down, it will also be easier and faster to repair than many other belting types and styles. Metal mesh belts, for instance, often require complex welding set repairs that lead to longer downtimes, while replacement parts for modular plastic belting systems can simply be snapped into place.
While metal mesh belts used to be the industry standard for food preparation, food-grade modular plastic belting is quickly taking over due to their flexibility, affordability, and ease of use.
Curious about the cost and energy savings that modular plastic conveyor belting can bring to your production line? Talk to the conveyor belt experts at MIPR Corp. We stock and customize a full range of modular plastic belting and we ship samples same-day!

Sanitizing Your Conveyor Belt
FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail
Despite the national slowdowns and lockdowns, many conveyor belts in critical applications are still running—and many more will be back online soon as different states and sectors of the economy reopen. It has never been more important to be sure that your conveyor belts are running clean. Slowing and stopping the transmission of COVID-19 is on everyone’s minds. From antimicrobial belts and food grade belting to powerful, practical advice on cleaning and sterilizing all belting types, the experienced engineering experts at MIPR Corp. are helping a wide range of industries step up their cleaning and sanitization protocols with conveyor belt safety tips to keep their staff and their customers safe.
When the Food Safety Modernization Act passed in 2011, our team worked closely with clients across the U.S. to ensure the compliance of their food conveyor belting. The products and techniques we developed to step up prevention efforts have added to our expertise in sanitary conveyor belting. If you have concerns, we have answers and solutions.
First and foremost, keeping sanitary conveyor belting on your production line means designing for easy, thorough, and frequent cleaning and regular conveyor belt maintenance. This means making sure all parts of your frames and belts are accessible—no nooks and crannies where food or germs can accumulate. (Frame-outs and belt lifters—which automatically separate the belt from the frame for cleaning—can be a big help here.) Avoiding horizontal surfaces where materials can pool is another way to improve sanitization—inclines encourage runoff, and proper use of catch pans can keep excess off the floor for proper disposal. Last but not least, ensuring all of your splices are smooth and completely sealed with no pinholes or bumps will also help prevent cross-contamination.
We are able to roll over and seal the belt edges. This eliminates fabric exposed edges and pressure washer cleaning damage, belt edges that last much longer.
Our engineers are always happy to evaluate your current production line to identify opportunities for improvement, so don’t hesitate to call and ask for a consultation.
Not sure how to clean a conveyor belt?
Our engineers recommend the following conveyor belt cleaning system:
cleaning your frames from the center out whenever possible
dry-cleaning to remove large, visible debris
pre-rinsing before applying any detergent to clear out smaller particulates
leaving detergents on belting and frames for 10-15 minutes to reach maximum effectiveness
rinsing thoroughly, and using PH strips to test for detergent residue before sanitizing the belt
ATP testing for bacteria after cleaning
sanitizing carefully according to manufacture product instructions
requiring staff to wear protective equipment (gloves, masks, eye protection) where indicated
testing tracking before putting your belt back into service
welded edges, no more strings hanging out
The type of belting you choose can also have an enormous impact on sanitary conditions on your production line:
ANTI-MICROBIAL AND FOOD GRADE BELTS
From empty shelves at grocery stores to sweeping restaurant shutdowns, few areas of our economy have been hit harder by the coronavirus crisis than food service. We need safe, reliable food supply chains more than ever, and antimicrobial conveyor belting plays a key role in ensuring food preparation can keep moving forward.
FDA-approved antimicrobial conveyor belting can stand up to a wide range of temperatures and preparation techniques—high heat, flash freezing, cutting, shaping, molding, and more. Our newest anti-microbial, PURclean, is FDA-approved and ideal for the food industry and medical grade applications. It is no-fray, fabric wicking, easy to clean, fabricate, and field splice. In fact, for many products, it’s a quick and easy drop-in!
Sanitary belting strengthens your FDA food safety plan’s preventative controls. Think your bakery or food production line is too unique for a standard antimicrobial conveyor belt? Think again! MIPR Corp has created custom antimicrobial conveyor belting for over 40 years. From tortillas to ice cream, from meat and cheese to candy and sugar to breads and beers, our creative experts have successfully engineered safe and sanitary solutions that work.
FOOD-GRADE BELTING
USDA-approved food grade belting is designed to stand up to intensive and rigorous cleaning and sanitizing, may feature special nonstick coatings to resist grease and oil, and can handle tough temperatures and procedures like baking, cooling, freezing, cutting, extrusion, molding, lamination, and more.
Our conveyor belt experts listen carefully to the details of your production line and can help you choose the perfect food grade belt to step up your sanitation. Our custom belt experts make sure you also get the right lacing and splicing techniques for maximum durability and safety.
MIPR stocks the complete range of food grade belting, from white food belting to metal mesh, plastic modular, Teflon, and glass—and we ship same-day samples nationwide.
If your business has slowed or stopped due to coronavirus closures, there has never been a better time to evaluate your conveyor belting and make much-needed changes. When you reopen, will you be working with less staff? Working faster to fulfill a big backlog? Working around new intensive cleaning and sanitization requirements? Our conveyor belting experts are on-call to help you meet any challenge that comes up during these uncertain times, from recommendations to replacements to repairs. We even ship samples same-day!
