275. Cutting Keyways in Shafts (MAXNOVO Machine)
2020-05-27
MAXNOVO Machine: USING the lathe, either planning or milling operations can be employed for cutting keyways in shafts. Planing is always an operation for which the tool is mounted sideways on the slide at centre height, and moved along by the saddle; b u t milling is more varied and must be adapted to the type of key to be used. Milling with a slotting cutter produces the same type of open ended keyway as planing-to take a feather or gib key. But a keyway for a sunken key which has rounded ends, both enclosed by the metal of the shaft, must be produced with an endmill. And a keyway for a Woodruff or “ half-round ” key must be cut with a Woodruff keyway cutter. Suitable set-ups can easily be made for all these operations; but in milling there are points to observe in regard to direction of feed of wbrk and of rotation of cutters, and taking up backlash to avoid digging-in.
Cutting Keyways in Shafts
For planing a keyway, the shaft is held in the chuck, and if it is long so that it requires support from the tailstock, the centre in this should be a cut-away type to allow the tool to enter or leave without damage. The chuck can be fixed by a bar to the lathe bed or by engaging backgear. A flat-bottomed hole where the keyway will end allows planing towards the chuck-regulating the cross-feed, and easing back the tool for return strokes. Alternatively, the tool may be eased out to leave a slope similar to that of slot-milling; though for that type of end, careful feeding in of the tool on successive cuts and planning towards the tailstock may give better In milling with a slotting cutter or Woodruff keyway cutter, backlash should be taken up so that normal rotation of the cutter cannot drag the work forward and cause a dig-in which can result in a broken cutter. It means the shaft must be set for upward feed, or above the cutter for cross-feed, as at Al and 2; while in cutting a Woodruff keyway, the fixed setting should be ma& with the backlash taken upwards, as at B.
Advantages of reverse drive  When a lathe-driving motor will reverse, as is usually the case, there are advantages in running a cutter backwards, with the work mounted on the vertical slide for down feed, or on the slotted cross-slide to pass beneath the cutter with cross-feed. The advantages are that more room is available upwards than downwards for a mounting on the vertical slide, and better support and a longer feed with a front mounting on the crossslide: than with one at the rear. A slotting cutter can be turned on its mandrel for running backwards; and if a Woodruff keyway cutter is made (from silver steel), a similar shank each side will admit of use either way. A holder can be provided to fit in the taper of the spindle, as at C, where it can be held by a long bolt.
Split blocks, as at D and E, ,provide ‘a suitable mounting for each end of a shaft when bolted to fixed blocks, with cuts obtained by packing under the split blocks, the holes in the fixed blocks being oversize or slotted to permit adjustment. One of each pair of split blocks, as shown, may be thicker than the other, for recessing to take the centre nut on the piece of studding. This allows adjustment without loosening the shaft in the split blocks-so that proper alignment is obtained on successive cuts. In many instances, one pair of split blocks, but with two holding studs, and a longer fixed block, will make a satisfactory set-up. Split blocks when mounted on an angle plate on the vertical slide or cross-slide, as at F, also provide a mounting for a shaft for endmilling a keyway, or milling a keyway for a sunken key-between two drilled flat bottomed holes. For either operation, with the set-up having no bolts or clamps at the working edge, the endmill can be very stubby-and so without deflection, for the keyway to cut the correct width.

35. Simple Cutter Grinding (MAXNOVO Machine)
2016-06-30
MAXNOVO Machine: ALTHOUGH it is possible to sharpen circular saws and cutters merely by grinding the front face of each tooth, and although this is the only method possible for some tools, a considerable amount of cutter grinding is nevertheless done on the clearance or relief angles of teeth. It has the merit of sharpening the cutter, while at the same time bringing it circular. In a works, the machine employed is a universal grinder or a tool-and-cutter grinder. The exceptions to this method of grinding for sharpening are tools with complicated profiles, like taps and circular gear cutters. To sharpen these the only practicable method is to grind the front faces of the teeth. In the case of a tap, grinding the profile for sharpening, even if possible, would reduce the diameter and the thread produced would be too tight. But for a circular saw, a slitting cutter, or a roller mill, the loss of diameter is of no importance. Grinding on the top face or clearance angle of each tooth has the advantage of bringing the cutter circular, so that in use the work is evenly spread over all the teeth. In some instances if the cutter is not carefully ground or the mandrel on which it is mounted wobbles this does not occur. Then there is a type of rhythmic cutting with vibration, and the finished surface is irregular or full of chatter marks.
Simple Cutter Grinding
The principle of grinding on the clearance angles of teeth is as at A. A cup-type grinding wheel may be used and the cutter mounted on a mandrel, free to turn in bearings or a bracket. A support is arranged for the tooth being ground; and the cutter is simply held by hand to the support and traversed past the grinding wheel. When a tooth has been ground, the cutter is turned to the next one without altering the feed. Naturally, the height of the cutter and of its support are such that the required angles is ground on each tooth. Where a grinder is not available, a lathe can be used on this principle, running the grinding wheel on a mandrel in the chuck and fixing a support strip on a block bolted to the lathe bed. For the cutter, a simple mandrel can be attached to the vertical slide which will provide the means of height adjustment. Cut can be put on from the leadscrew feed to the saddle, while traverse will be from the cross feed.An end mill may be sharpened in this fashion, as at B, showing a method of mounting a small mill by its parallel shank in a simple jig on the vertical slide when a lathe is used. Such a jig may be made by boring a hole for the mill shank in a block of material like aluminium, and fixing a support strip by screws.
A collar each side if the block locates the mill, while permitting rotation from tooth to tooth. For a larger shell mill, as at C, a mandrel must be provided to mount in the jig, though the principle is the same.Spiral teeth as on a lawnmower rotor or a wide roller mill, can be sharpened on lathe set-ups. With any spiral tooth cutter, either it or the grinding wheel must be traversed, while the cutter is kept down to the support strip-so that it turns slightly in grinding a tooth.To grind a lawnmower rotor, one end of the spindle can be held m the chuck, the other supported by the tailstock. Using a portable grinder the support strip must be arranged on the saddle below the wheel, as at D. Each tooth or blade, is then kept down to the support as the saddles is traversed. To grind a roller mill, grinding wheel and support are as at A, with the mill mounted on a simple jig, as at E. This is on the vertical slide, cross-wide over the bed. The mill is then merely held down to the support strip and pushed along the mandrel past the grinding wheel.

212. Use of Toolmaker Buttons  (MAXNOVO Machine)
2019-09-03
MAXNOVO Machine: THOUGH it would, perhaps,. Be difficult to establish Just when toolmaker’s buttons came into common use, a substantial claim could be made for their influence in raising the standards of precision on which manufacturing processes now depend. Before the jig-borer appeared, they were the sole means by which systems of holes could be laid out precisely-or at least to an accuracy limited only by that of the measuring equipment. Consequently, a great deal might be different from what it is now, had toolmaker’s buttons never been known-although, obviously, they are the sort of things any number of reflective machinists might have invented. Using two buttons held by screws to the face of work or a jig, they can be spaced, measuring over them by micrometer, and firmly fixed. Then in a set-up on a lathe, a button is trued by indicator, removed, and the hole opened out to size by drilling and boring. The second hole is produced in the same way, and so the spacing of the two is that at which the buttons were set.
Use of Toolmaker Buttons
Number no problem Any reasonable number of buttons can be set by measurement of pairs, checking either overall or between them, with no real difficulties occurring so long as the centre dimensions for each pair are known. That is not always the case, however; and sometimes preliminary calculations are necessary. The most obvious and frequent example involving calculation is as at A, where there are holes on a pitch circle at angle 0. The radius is R, with centre hole S, and holes T and U on the pitch circle. Using a button at S, or a plug in a hole previously machined, the setting of a button for either hole T or U can be done by overall or between measurement, on the basis of radius R. But to space all three holes precisely, it is necessary to know dimension V, a straight line between centres of holes T and U, which can be arrived at through trigonometry.
If angle @ is divided by two and a line run out, it joins at the mid position the straight one between T and U, and two equal right-angled triangles are formed-one shown with close hatching. Looking up the angle @/2 in sine tables, a decimal fraction is obtained, and this is multplied by R and 2 which gives dimension V. The same result follows more directly if the diameter of the pitch circle is given and not its radius. That is, there is no need to halve a pitch circle in order to work with the radius. If R is run across the circle to W, and this point joined to U, a larger triangle is formed which is similar to the smaller one, and right angled on the theorem that “the angle in a semi-circle is a right-angle.” So referring again to the sine of o/2, and multiplying the fraction by the diameter, V is arrived at directly. There are other methods of obtaining angular spacings, but this one takes care of any value of @ less than 90 deg.
On a straight line Locating a number of buttons on a straight line is another practical problem for which the solution is as at B, using a straight-edge X clamped to the work so the buttons can be brought to it. On a similar principle, having located one button from an edge, the inward setting of another can be achieved through a block Y, for a single measurement Z to set the second button. Checking of buttons on a straight line and in relation to an edge can be done on a surface plate, with the work set up and “ clocked " true on an angle plate, as at C. A test over all buttons shows if there is any variation in height. A plate carrying a button suitably set from its edge can be used in setting an angle plate, as at D; while a plate with button can be mounted on the face of a component, as at E, for locating a sunken hole. Again, as at F, a plate may carry a button and be clamped to the faceplate for a component to be located on it.

54. Accurate Length Machining (MAXNOVO Machine)
2017-05-30
MAXNOVO Machine: AS in the case of diameters, there is not always the need for precision on width and length measurements-but when it is demanded accuracy is no less important on the one than the other. Given a micrometer, diameters can easily be checked as work proceeds; but if width and length measurements have habitually been made with a rule-with all the variations that that implies -the need for greater precision may find one unprepared. Yet accuracy when machining widths and lengths is relatively easy to achieve. On a lathe having a topslide feed with graduated collar readings can be taken from this for positioning tools for facing cuts, and in some instances longer lengths can be obtained using the leading screw. Again, very accurate work can be done using simple gauges for setting tools, and this is often practised as occasion demands even on lathes fitted with feed collars. For old-type lathes without feed collars, or on which screws are worn, the use of gauges is virtually imperative to ensure precision and speed up production. The principle is as illustrated at A, where a piece of material is turned with two shoulders.
Accurate Length Machining
The lengths could be measured with a rule,; but a much more precise and speedier way is to machine the lengths slightly oversize then employ two gauges Xl, X2, to set the tool for finishing cuts. With the lathe stopped, a gauge is held to its respective shoulder and the tool set just to touch; then the gauge is removed and the cut taken at the precise position. In most workshops there are numerous objects of reasonable precision, such as drill shanks, silver steel rod, pieces of ground tool steel, etc., in standard sizes which can be used as gauges. If a micrometer is available material may also be turned or filed to size, and then it is possible to add to or delete from nominal dimensions for particular fits. For example, if a flange is nominally 1/8in. wide, but for a clearance fit 0.002 in. endplay is desirable, then the gauge could be made 1/8 in. minus 0.002 in. Again, if necessary, widths and lengths can be obtained falling between inch fractions, which would demand estimation on a rule. The chuck face or a jaw can be used as a datum for gauges, but one extra is required since the two gauges, Yl, Y2, only locate the end face and one shoulder; another would be needed for the second shoulder. Besides this, the gauges are in general longer and would require to be made specially.
On second operations, however, measurements can be made from the chuck face or jaws, though when a holder is used it is best to work from its face which, as at B, should be flat and large enough to take the gauges squarely. As at C, a recess can be machined to depth by finishing the interior over-length, then using a gauge to set the tool for the outside facing cut. Where a groove must be accurately located from the end face, either of two methods can be employed. The tool edge may be set flush with the end face, then taken in by feed collar reading, or a step gauge can be used, C. The principle is applicable to backfacing flanges, as at D, where the gauge is a simple adjustable type set by using a block of suitable thickness in conjunction with a straight-edge. A variation of such a step gauge -snipped or sawn, then filed from sheet metal-is as at E for obtaining the over-all dimension of a pair of flanges on a shaft machined between centres. Beyond the flanges, the shorter lengths can be obtained with other gauges. Locating from the saddle, as at F, an adjustable stop can be fitted to the headstock to take gauges in the space.

43. Lathe Milling (MAXNOVO Machine)
2016-12-05
MAXNOVO Machine: A centre lathe with vertical slide and angle plate is equipped for many operations that would otherwise require a universal milling machine. For you can make single-point tools perform the same operations as multiple-tooth cutters by reducing the rate of feed so that a gig-in cannot occur. You can make the tools from round and square bits and pieces of silver steel rod, to mount in holders in chucks or to fit in the taper in the lathe spindle. The cost in cash is small. If time presses, and you must keep to bare essentials, there are several easy-to-make holders that can be made from mild steel bar. They can be case-hardened or left soft. For frequent use, you should case-harden them before they become dented and worn. According to need, you can set the vertical slide squarely or at angles on the cross-slide. The angle plate you can mount on the vertical slide, flat or sloping. To put on cuts, you have the screws for the cross and vertical slides. Any of these screws can be used to move work past a rotating cutter; and so, besides making set-ups at compound angles, you can feed work in any of three planes at right-angles. Diagram A shows some typical operations which are performed by running tools in the chuck with the work mounted on the vertical slide. For boring A1, you can sometimes use an ordinary boring tool in the independent chuck.
Lathe Milling
If the hole is small, you can make a round-shanked tool from silver steel rod and mount it in a holder. In each case, set the tool by adjusting it in the chuck jaws. Fix the vertical slide and cross-slide by the screws to their gib pieces, or wedge the slides with packing to prevent movement. Feed the work by the saddle. For facing A2, you can fit a round tool in a reamed hole in a rectangular mild steel holder, fixing it through a grub screw. Adjust the circle swept by the tool by setting the tool and the holder. Apply cut to the work from the saddle, locking this to the bed or retaining its position with lead-screw nut. Feed the work with the cross-slide or vertical slide. For slotting or grooving A3, you can use an end-mill in a holder in the chuck, setting the tool to run concentrically. Apply cut again from the saddle, and feed the work by the cross-slide or vertical slide. The ordinary end-mill has two cutting edged so that the end of the tool appears as at B1. To re-sharpen it, you need an accurate square-edged grinding wheel. When this creates a problem, the solution is to make an end-mill with a single cutting edge, B2. Then you can re-sharpen it on any flat face on a grinding wheel. The single-edged end-mill will do the same job as a double-edge type when it is run fast with slow feed for the work. You can make a holder to mount round-shank tools in the independent chuck as at B3. Chunk two pieces of rectangular mil steel bar; face and centre the end and drill through undersize. Finish the bore with a standard drill or a reamer. The abutting edges of the pieces you can ease with a file for the holder to grip the shanks firmly.
To keep the halves of such a holder together, turn the ends circular and machine the grooves for circlips, B4 Make the circlips from coils of springs. A shank pushes into the holder with a friction grip. Another holder for a chuck is shown at C, upper diagram. In this the tool is clamped by a grooved cotter made from a bolt. Fit the bolt first. Drill and ream the hole for the tool. Then cut the head off the bolt. The holder at C, lower diagram, has a taper shank to fit in the lathe spindle. The rear end can be tapped for a draw-bolt. You slit the other end with a saw to line WX for clamping. A holder for square tools, diagram D, consists of a centre block with side-plates YZ fixed by countersunk screws.

266. Holding and Supporting for Drilling (MAXNOVO Machine)
2020-04-22
MAXNOVO Machine: USING a vertical or precision drilling machine, the operation of drilling is easily performed on normal materials, so that any problems which arise in its use concern the holding or supporting of parts. Given satisfactory solutions in these respects, holes can be accurately located and breakage of drills avoided. Of course, a considerable amount of drilling can be done holding the work by hand on the drill table or by mounting it in a machine vice; but anything which is somewhat out of the ordinary may call for other or modified methods and a suitable machine vice is not always to hand. Small table area In general work, a problem that often occurs has its basis in the inadequate area of the machine table. Perhaps only part of the component can be placed on it, and the overhanging portion has to be held up while drilling is done-a risky procedure for the drill. The solution is temporarily to enlarge the area, using a piece of good hard parallel board. Holes can be drilled for countersunk metal screws, by which it can be held by clamps gripping the underside of the machine table. Alternatively, a piece of metal plate of sufficient thickness-particularly aluminium because of its lightness- be mounted in the same manner.
Holding and Supporting for Drilling
For small parts, even a machine vice leaves something to be desired if it tends to be disproportionately large. There is also the need to keep work up near the top face of the jaws, which implies a heavy grip if it is not to push down-or packing must be placed’ beneath it. Often the best way is to use a toolmaker’s clamp on the work, as at A, gripping with both laid on a flat surface. Then the work can go straight on the drill table or on a piece of protective packing placed there. Using angle iron Two pieces of angle iron can be used in similar fashion to toolmaker’s clamps, as an alternative to a machine vice. An example of their use is setting up a slide valve cylinder to drill the valve face, as at B. A bolt can go right through the cylinder, and with it partly tightened, the face to be drilled can be set horizontal on a faceplate using a surface gauge tapping the face true with a piece of lead, and finally tightening the bolt fully. Angular faces on components can be set horizontal in this way; and for parts without holes, the pieces of angle iron can be longer and fitted with two bolts.
A single piece of angle iron admits of setting up work which is long and must be drilled endwise-such as a connecting-rod to take bolts for the cap, as at C. Such work can hang down the side of the drill table, where there would probably not be sufficient space for it to stand on top. Two clamps may be needed for a connecting-rod and cap, as shown. The angle iron is bolted to the drill table with this slewed round, to align each centre punch dot in turn beneath the drill point. Two pieces of angle iron clamped to the drill table, as at D, can provide outrigger edges to take work clamped to the underside of a piece of plate. This plate may be accurately marked off and drilled beforehand to serve as a template; and with free space between the edges of the angles, it can be manoeuvred as required to align the holes to the drill.
Also on the outrigger principle, a support can be arranged for drilling round the end of tubing-a boiler barrel, for example, as at E. For this, the support can be square hard wood, machined circular at the outer end. A length can be countersunk for this end, then set up in the lathe with support from the tailstock centre, and the other end trued in the independent four-jaw chuck. For bolting to the drill table, there can be a vertical hole, or holes, through the square part. Drilling out holes in washers poses a problem of holding which can be solved, as at F, when they are few in number, by clamping each one between two pieces of plate. In clamping, alignment can be effected through a length of stepped rod, its turned down diameter the original size of the hole, and its top diameter the size to which the hole is to be drilled out.

140. Balancing Single Cylinder Engines (MAXNOVO Machine)
2018-12-11
MAXNOVO Machine: ALLIED to crankshaft construction for single-cylinder engines, particularly those intended to run at high speed, is the problem of balance, since it is while the crankshaft is being made that provision can best be effected for subsequent balancing. That is, the crankshaft webs can be suitably shaped or extended to avoid the necessity for separate balance weights-with the need for secure mounting to obviate the possibility of their working loose in service. The need for balancing is obvious on the simple thesis that to start matter in motion requires a force, and to stop it demands another force, while the greater the “ weight ” of matter and the more sudden the starting and stopping, the greater the forces involved. In an engine, the major reciprocating parts comprising piston, rings, gudgeon pin and part of the connecting rod, set up forces along their line of travel; and if the engine is unbalanced, the forces, acting through its structure and mountings, set up vibration. Lightness in the reciprocating parts is important to keep the forces as small as possible. Hence, in high speed engines,. it is customary to employ alummmm-alloy pistons, hollow steel gudgeon pins and duralumin connecting rods. In certain types of engine, good balance is achieved in opposing one set of reciprocating parts by another. The flat-twin horizontally-opposed petrol engine and the single-acting vertical twin steam-engine are examples.
Balancing Single Cylinder Engines
In a single-cylinder engine, although it is usual to speak of balancing, complete balance is not possible-the unbalance is shifted from one direction to another. In reference to diagram A, a balance weight could be attached to provide a force W completely to balance WI set up by the reciprocating parts at top dead centre and again at bottom dead centre. But the crank being turned at right angles there is no force to oppose comletely that of the balance weight in direction X, and at a further half turn in direction Xl. So the engine would be no less unbalanced than before.To avoid this, the unbalance is divided, the force W opposing only part of that W1, and forces acting at X and Xl are thereby reduced. Usually, the balance weight corresponds to the whole of the revolving masses, which can be balanced, plus half the reciprocating masses. The piston with rings and gudgeon pin are reciprocating masses, so half. these weights are taken. The small end of the connecting rod is a reciprocating mass, half of which is taken, too. But the big end is a revolving mass, so the whole of this is taken.
Using a balancing bar and cotton, and steel balls or lead shot in a tissue paper bag, the piston complete is weighed, as at B, and half taken. The connecting rod big end is weighed, as at C, and the whole of this taken the small end resting on a block. The small end is weighed similarly, and half taken.
The total number of balls or shot then form a weight which should hold the crankpin horizontal when suspended from it by cotton, as at D, with the crankshaft resting on knife edges-which can be strips of steel about 1/32in. thick bolted each side of a board, and this levelled in the vice. A heavy balance, weight is corrected by reducing its stze, or drilling or enlarging holes such as Y, Yl. Often, however, the difficulty is to provide sufficient weight in the web. The crankpin can be partially drilled to help, and where the crankshaft size is determined by the crankcase, the balance weight can be extended sideways, as far as connecting rod clearance will permit, as at E. Where the shaft runs in the open, the balance weight can be extended radially Z beyond the circle swept by the crankpin. For extra weight, a lead plug can be used at times, held in by a steel screw; and where no provision has been made, a steel balance weight can be bolted on.

32. Some Facts about Tapers (MAXNOVO Machine)
2016-05-23
MAXNOVO Machine: Apart from many other uses a taper is often the means of securing a flywheel, a sprocket, a gear or pulley to a shaft either with or without a key. For such purposes, a taper is usually mechanically more satisfactory than a plain interference fit between shaft and bore, a sliding fit with a drive-in key, or a sliding fit with a locating shoulder and, a nut for holding.
The angle of a taper has a considerable influence on the grip exerted when components are pulled together; and the smaller the angle, or the less the change in diameter for unit length, the more powerful the hold. A taper may be dimensioned or designated in two common ways, A. The angle, P, may be given irrespective of the size of the shaft, which may be convenient when the angle is a whole degree, such as 5 deg., or whole degree and a simple fraction, such as 6 deg. Alternatively, the smaller and larger diameters, Q and R, may be given and the distance, S, between them. In such an event, the taper may also be given as so much per foot or per inch as the case may be.
On a lathe, a fairly quick taper is machined by setting the topslide at an angle and using this for machining; while a slow or gradual taper longer than can be machined from the topslide is produced by setting over the tailstock, or using a set-over centre when the work is mounted between centres. Again, on lathes so equipped, a taper turning attachment may be used to control movement of the cross-slide, leaving the work in longitudinal alignment with the lathe bed. Some experiments are virtually always necessary in setting up for machining a taper, since no graduation, particularly of the topslide, is sufficiently accurate. Moreover, it is important for the tool to be at centre height, otherwise, variations in shape and angle occur, B. When the tool is at centre height it lies on the horizontal centre line of the shaft, where the slide angle is the same as the taper. If the tool is dropped, however, to plane, T, the effect on the larger diameter, U, is much less than on the smaller diameter, V. In obtaining well-fitting tapers, size, angle and finish, both externally and internally, are extremely important. If one has the choice when fitting two parts on a “one-off” job the shaft is better finished last, as it is the more easily adjusted for size to secure longitudinal location, and the simpler to provide with a good finish, or on which to correct small inaccuracies, from careful use of a fine (Swiss) file and/or abrasive cloth. Variations in longitudinal location with size are shown at C, where the component moves from W to X as the bore is increased.
Some Facts about Tapers
If there is no choice in procedure, as when fitting a new sprocket to an existing shaft, the taper is picked up on the topslide with the shaft in the lathe and a mandrel turned to the same taper, but smaller. This is used for preliminary testing, though the final testing should be with the shaft itself. Illustrations, D, show some ways in which an internal taper can be faulty. The bore may be large on the outside or inside, when on entering the mandrel and “feeling”, slackness can be noticed. Pushing in the mandrel and twisting also shows where the taper is touching. When the taper is faulty, the topslide requires adjustment. Finish is important, since if the mandrel rides on ridges the fitting will be poor though the angle may be correct. Slight correction and improvement follows from grinding the parts together, but too much reliance should not be placed on this. For small bores, silver-steel tools, E, can be made by bending as Y or turning to leave a diameter, Z, both of which can be filed to shape, then hardened and tempered. Of course, with a taper reamer available, or made from silver steel sizing and finishing are simplified.

27. Accurate Length Machining (MAXNOVO Machine)
2016-04-01
MAXNOVO Machine: AS in the case of diameter, there is not always the need for precision on width and length measurements, but when it is demanded accuracy is no less important on the one than the other. Given a micrometer, diameters can easily be checked as work proceeds; but if width and length measurements have habitually been made with a rule, with all the variations that implies, the need for greater precision may find one unprepared. Yet accuracy when machining widths and lengths is relatively easy to achieve. On a lathe having a topslide feed with graduated collar readings can be taken from this for positioning tools for facing cuts, and in some instances longer lengths can be obtained using the leading screw. Again, very accurate work can be done using simple gauges for setting tools, and this is often practiced as occasion demands even on lathes fitted with feed collars. For old-type lathes without feed collars, or on which screws are worn, the use of gauges is virtually imperative to ensure precision and speed up production. The principle is as illustrated at A, where a piece of material is turned with two shoulders. The lengths could be measured with a rule; but a much more precise and speedier way is to machine the lengths slightly oversize then employ two gauges X1, X2, to set the tool for finishing cuts. With the lathe stopped, a gauge is held to its respective shoulder and the tool set just to touch; then the gauge is removed and the cut taken at the precise position. In most workshops there are numerous objects of reasonable precision, such as drill shanks, silver-steel rod, pieces of ground tool steel, etc., in standard sizes which can be used as gauges. If a micrometer is available material may also be turned or filed to size, and then it is possible to add to or delete from nominal dimensions for particular fits. For example, if a flange is nominally 1/8 in. wide, but for a clearance fit 0.002 in. endplay is desirable, then the gauge could be made 1/8 in. minus 0.002 in. Again, if necessary, widths and lengths can be obtained falling between inch fractions, which would demand estimation on a rule.
Accurate Length Machining
The chuck face or a jaw can be used as a datum for gauges, but one extra is required since the two gauges, Y1, Y2, only locate the end face and one shoulder; another would be needed for the second shoulder. Besides this, the gauges are in general longer and would require to be made specially. On second operations, however, measurements can be made from the chuck face or jaws, though when a holder is used it is best to work from its face which, as at B, should be flat and large enough to take the gauges squarely. As at C, a recess can be machined to depth by finishing the interior over-length, then using a gauge to set the tool for the outside facing cut. Where a groove must be accurately located from the end face, either of two methods can be employed. The tool edge may be set flush with the end face, then taken in by feed collar reading, or a step gauge can be used, C. The principle is applicable to back-facing flanges, as at D, where the gauge is a simple adjustable type set by using a block of suitable thickness in conjunction with a straight-edge. A variation of such a step gauge - snipped or sawn, then filed from sheet metal – is as at E for obtaining the over-all dimension of a pair of flanges on a shaft machined between centres. Beyond the flanges, the shorter lengths can be obtained with other gauges. Locating from the saddle, as at F, an adjustable stop can be fitted to the headstock to take gauges in the space, Z.

176. Lapping External Threads (MAXNOVO Machine)
2019-04-18
MAXNOVO Machine: GIVEN acquaintance with the principles involved, the lapping of external threads of the V-type involves little more difficulty than the lapping of conventional bores, shafts, ends, edges and flat surfaces.The lapping may be local to correct errors where there is a tight place on the thread, or it may be performed over the entire length to smooth the whole profile and bed it to a nut for this to work easily and without shake. Faults in any of the elements of the thread can be dealt with separately as required-on the top radius, the root radius, or the flanks.
Lapping External Threads
In general, the lapping process can be applied where a shortish thread is just too tight for the mating part or where a long thread is not uniform throughout; where no die is available for correction or where time and trouble would be required to set up the part accurately in a lathe; where use of a die or lathe would not be appropriate because the thread is hard; and particularly where a thread needs to be well finished such as if it is on the feed screw of a simple measuring device or tool. When a tap corresponding to the pitch and diameter of the thread is available, it can be employed for a lap of the split-nut variety to correct and smooth the whole of a thread profile. A piece of brass or aluminium alloy is drilled and tapped, drilled for a bolt, then split, as at A.
Initially, if too tight, it can be opened with a wedge; or alternatively, it can be made longer, provided with a second bolt, and cut right through to clamp on-which, incidentally’ simplifies cleaning. Use of the lap can be by hand or it can be held by hand while the part with the thread is rotated in the lathe-when it is advantageous if the lathe can be reversed. Cleaned of abrasive and applied dry, the lap finally serves as a very good gauge for checking uniformity of the thread, end to end. A lap more speedy to use on work in the lathe can be made from a steel or brass nut with a good thread shape. A piece of material is soldered on for a handle, then the nut is cut through to leave rather less than half attached, as at B. This lap can be dropped on the thread where required, lifted off, applied again-and a “ tight ” area lapped down with the minimum of effort. It can also be started off the extreme running-on end of the thread for this to be lapped equally with portions further back.
A lap of the same type, but engaging only a single “ groove ” of the thread, can be made from flat strip material filed approximately to thread angle and pressed on with both hands after the manner of a file, edgewise, and in line with the lead of the thread, as at C. Abrasive can be applied with a brush to the thread-and for the lap to run off the end of a right-hand one, the lathe must rotate backwards. The same type of lap can be used for correcting the flanks of threads without touching the root radius, merely by ensuring the bottom is flattened, as at Dl, where contact is on the sloping sides. On the same principle, using a strip of suitable thickness material rounded at the edge, and bolted between two thicker pieces to provide stability, as at D2, the root radius only of a thread can be lapped, as at D3. Another method of doing this is to draw a wire of appropriate diameter into the abrasive-brushed thread, as at E, the wire preferably having a handle each end for manipulation without danger to fingers. For correcting the top diameter radius of a thread, laps can be blocks of lead into which the thread has been carefully forced in a vice, as at F.

110. Circular Clips(2) (MAXNOVO Machine)
2018-08-29
MAXNOVO Machine: NOT SO MANY years ago a circlip as a locating device was something of a rarity, not inspiring full confidence in engineers. Some thought it likely to work loose or jump out of its groove in use, to break from vibration, or soften or distort when subjected to heat-with more or less disastrous results. Some circlips did, in fact, give trouble-from wrong material, wrong application or fitting. But modem examples are among the simplest and most reliable locating devices, if a few simple rules are followed.
Circlips, like split pins, are advisedly regarded as expendable items and used only once. Where side thrust is likely to be encountered; they should be of rectangular section, seating properly in accurate square sided grooves. Round section types in half-round grooves may compress or expand (depending on the application) and push out. Such circlips should always be sunk in their grooves to at least half the diameter of their section. With circlips of soft material, which have to be squeezed into grooves, care must be taken to do this properly. Common types Popular types of internal and external circlips are shown at A to E. Type A is of rectangular section to fit a square-sided groove in a bore, and is provided with two holes for compressing with a suitable tool when fitting or extracting. Type B is also for a bore, and of round wire with the ends turned in for manipulating with narrow-jawed pliers. Type C is of round wire and may be fitted in a bore or on a shaft-sprung in or on, and levered and pushed out with a screwdriver blade. All these are hardened and tempered and, consequently, springy.
Circular Clips
Type D for external fitting is soft, however, and of rectangular section provided with lugs at the ends for squeezing it into its groove. Type E is also rectangular section, but springy, and for external fitting-Its ends being chamfered inwards to permit of easy levering out.
Common uses for type A circlip are for end-locating gudgeon pins in pistons, F, and for similarly locating bushes in needle roller universal joints. The circlip should only be used once, and great care exercised to seat it properly. Type D circlip fits in a groove, G, and is often used for car brake shoe pivots. Type E circlip is employed where a ball race, H, carries a groove in its outer member, the circlip then locating it endwise in the housing.
Piston circlips can be manipulated with small round-nosed pliers or a tool, Z, with reduced diameters at the ends to fit in the circlip holes. Full compression and square extraction from the bore are necessary, since accuracy of fitting is such that the circlip cannot be withdrawn aslant. The ball race circlip can be removed as J, using a screwdriver blade under one of the ends, lifting out an sidd eways placing another screwdriver behind and working right round. For brake shoe pivot circlips, balu ntended punch or chisel K, , can be used for opening and freeing, and the ends of the circlip tapped with a hammer as if to drive it over the diameter. Then with the circlip loose, it is usually possible to enter a small punch or screwdriver at the back opposite the lugs, and so lever the circlip off. A stout circlip or locking ring on a splined shaft can prove very difficult to remove. An easy way, however, unless the material is hard, is to drill a hole from the side or above and away from the ends to weaken the circlip , L, until the ends can be levered open with a screwdriver or a blunt chisel used (as K). Careful cutting with a small chisel from the side and above will weaken a circlip. Fitting of circlips is usually straightforward, taking care they are seating correctly, though the soft type, D, is best squeezed with large pliers or ordinary pincers, M.

182. Making Tests for Gears (MAXNOVO Machine)
2019-05-08
MAXNOVO Machine: PRECISE though gears may he in themselves, satisfactory operation follows only when they are aligned and meshing correctly and set at designed centres or with specified backlash. Alignment is dealt with in another article, and marking tests for tooth contact areas, in conjunction with verification of backlash, together reveal if the best setting obtains. Checking contact areas of a pair of gears is straightforward enough. Both should be clean and dry; and into a few teeth of one of them a marking compound should be lightly brushed. Then they are rotated together-in one direction, then the other, and contacts are shown on the flanks. In normal operation, one gear is usually the “ driving ” one and the other the “ driven.” When the driving gear applies drive, pressure is on the “ drive side ” of the teeth. But when drive eases off, and the driven gear continues by momentum (as in car transmission), there is over-run and pressure comes on the “ over-run side ” of the teeth.
Making Tests for Gears
Checking in both directions leaves marks on both sides of the teeth, and unless one gear is specified as that to be turned in tests there can be two tests, applying drive from one gear then from the other. The compound employed can be marking blue-ready made up, or powdered red lead mixed to a thin paste with engine oil. Backlash is movement present when one gear is held stationary and the other oscillated. It is play at the pitch line, from a tooth being fractionally narrower than the space into which it fits. In general, it increases by setting gears away from one another, and within limits decreases by bringing them together. It is important, but not by itself an answer for meshing without marking tests.
In checking accurate gears like pinions and crown wheels, which are made in pairs and should never be mixed, both tests are essential. That for backlash, as at A, can be made with an indicator clipped to the casing flange.
Holding the pinion shaft stationary, backlash can be read, and the amount specified may be anything from 0.003 in. to about 0.008 in. With the indicator at an angle, a somewhat “ high ” reading should obtain, but with an arm giving a straight push, the reading should be spot on. The outside diameter of crown wheel teeth is the “heel ” and the inside the “ toe ” and by adjustments both crown wheel and pinion can be moved in and out, to obtain correct markings and backlash. Rotating the crown wheel and lightly braking the pinion shaft by hand, ideal markings are as at B, broad and central on both drive and over-run sides of the teeth. Divergences from ideal markings indicate incorrect setting, and while the gears would still function, they would certainly be noisy either on drive or over-run. Typical divergences are heavy contact at the tips or root of the teeth, and heel-and-toe contact of one form or another.
Heavy contact at the tips of crown wheel teeth, as at C, indicates the pinion is too far out of mesh. It should be moved in towards the crown wheel, then moved out to adjust backlash. The opposite condition-heavy contact at the root of the teeth-reveals the pinion is too deeply in mesh. So it should be moved out, and the crown wheel in (if necessary) to maintain backlash. With a heavy marking at the heel on the drive side and the toe on the over-run side, as at D, the remedy is to move the pinion out and the crown wheel in. For the converse condition, a heavy marking at the toe on the drive side and the heel on the overrun side, as at E, correction is made by moving the crown wheel out and the pinion in to maintain backlash. Means of moving the pinion and crown wheel vary. Shims are often used at the pinion housing flange, crown wheel adjustment being threaded rings with locking devices.

80. Sharpening Drills and Tools (MAXNOVO Machine)
2018-05-10
MAXNOVO Machine: MAINTAINING. DRILLS, Centre punches, chisels, scrapers, etc., keen and accurate is one, at least, of the secrets of producing good work. It involves the use of grinding, wheel, handhones and oil-stone. Hand hones are small abrasive slips obtainable in various shapes and sizes, for finishing tools to a fine edge after grinding. They are usually rubbed on tools. The oil stone, (a larger abrasive block), rests on the bench while tools are applied for finishing. Thin oil, such as cycle oil, should be used on an oil stone to float particles of metal away;, hand hones may also be fed with thm oil and both types, when dirty and clogged, can be scrubbed in paraffin. As with grinding wheels, the area of working should not be restricted for the hone or stone to become locally worn. For work on the grinder, whether or not preliminary, it is desirable for the drive to the wheel to be by power or foot treadle, leaving both hands free for the tool.
Sharpening Drills and Tools
Drill sharpening
For most work, twist drills have an included angle of 118 deg. and a clearance from each cutting edge of about 12 deg. The cutting edges or lips are straight and equal as seen in plan and clearance is curved on large drills, though it can be in the form of a flat on very small drills. The angles, while desirable, are not rigid in that a drill would not cut if ground otherwise. In practice, slight variations occur and even where a jig is available for maintaining accurate angles, free-hand grinding is often preferred. In sharpening a drill, it is applied to the face or the periphery of the wheel, horizontally and at the appropriate angle A, with the cutting edge horizontal. Care is observed that the cutting edges X, Y, are maintained as nearly as possible the same. Holding the drill as at A in contact with the running wheel, the nose is then lifted as at B, thus providing the clearance as at C.
A small drill can be applied twice to the grinding wheel at an angle producing a flat for clearance at each cutting edge. On a very tiny drill the flats can be produced rubbing on an oil’stone, or hand-honing with the drill in parallel-jaw pliers.
Punches and chisels
A centre punch with an’ angle of 60 deg., D, is sharpened by applying to the periphery or face of the wheel, twisting between fingers. Direction of twisting is not important, but the
rate should be fast to avoid flats. A tubular punch E for making holes in gaskets can be ground in a similar fashion. A chipped or ragged cutting edge, however, should first be squared on the face of the wheel. Afterwards the chamfer can be produced. Overheating can be avoided by dipping in water, and the chamfer hand-honed at the finish.
A gouge or half-round chisel F can be ground, not by twisting, but turning with wrist movements, firmly held-and finally hand-honed. With a normal wood chisel G, care is required to produce a true flat, a square cutting edge and not to overheat. Frequent cooling is essential and a coarse wheel initially desirable. Badly damaged edges involve extensive grinding, without which cutting angles are changed and the edges becoming “ dubbed off.” Triangular and hollow-ground scrapers H can be ground flat on the faces for sharpening, then handhoned. A wood chisel, however, is better finished or maintamed sharp on an oil stone I, rubbing at the appropriate angle, then passing the flat side of the blade along the stone to remove the feather edge.

10.Bending And Forming
2015-08-14
NUMBEROUS bending and forming operations can be performed in the vice with a hammer and simple mandrels and formers. From round rod can be made hooks, eyes, special staples, chain links; flat sheet or strip serves for light-section angles, channels, boxes and endplates. Small diameters and thin sections can be worked cold but for manipulating large sections using mild steel, a concentrated form of heating is desirable – such as a welding torch – which brings the metal to bright red heat. Heating prevents cracking in hard steels and some types of iron are prone to cracking if bent when cold. Cracking is also prevented in copper and brass sheet by annealing; this is performed by heating the material to red and plunging it in water. Some materials may tend to crack when bent in one plane and not when bent at right angles. Hard brass and copper, common iron and duralumin are most prone to cracking when working. The first and second should be annealed, the third worked at bright red heat and the last avoided except, for large-radii bends or when heat treatment is possible.
Bending And Forming
Forming an Eye
From wire, an eye can be turned on a piece of rod A using round-nosed pliers, but diameters of about 1/8 in. or over require the assistance of the vice. A mandrel from a piece of mild steel rod is then utilized; it is gripped in the vice with the rod B. It is convenient for the mandrel to be provided with a flat one side, filed for the vice jaw to grip; on the opposite side there can be a shallow groove at an angle to locate the rod to be used for the eye. This groove can be cut with a small round file. At the second stage of the work C, the end of the rod X is pulled against the edge of the vice to form the neck; the end Y is then carried round the mandrel to form the eye, as at D. Removed from the vice, the rod is tapped down the mandrel, the surplus cut off and the eye straightened by squeezing in the vice. E and F show the flat and the groove on the mandrel, while these may not be absolutely necessary, they do prevent movement while working. If produced cold, the eye will spring open slightly when pressure is released on the end of the rod Y. Consequently, a mandrel somewhat smaller than the finished inside diameter of the eye is required. At red heat, however, close-fitting eyes can be produced from mild steel rod.
How To Bend And Form
Links and Tee Handles
Chain links and tee handles G can be turned using simple holders. For the first stage H, a hole can be drilled through a piece of bar to take the rod, the end of the hole radiused if necessary. For the second stage, a split holder Z can be made by drilling at the joint of two pieces of bar. Cut to form jaws, they can be gripped about the rod for the second turn of a chain link and utilized as at J for the third turn forming a tee handle.
Channels and Flanges
Short angle lengths in strip metal can be hammered over the vice jaws but for long lengths the strip should be held between two lengths of angle iron K, gripped one end in the vice and the other fixed with a clamp. When an angle is formed, a channel L can be produced over a suitable section piece of bar. For turning thin, ductile sheet metal and strip, hardwood formers of oak or beech should be made to the inside dimensions required, as for the metal box at M. A piece of bar should be clamped on the opposite side of the sheet metal, level with the block where the corner is to be turned- this prevents buckling as the metal is turned over. Round flanged ends, as for small boilers, can be formed from copper discs held between two suitable large washers N and squeezed in a powerful vice. The discs should be annealed before hand; forming can be assisted part of the way through the operation by hammering over the smaller of the washers.
