Transformer Insulation for Oil cooled Transformers
Oil cooled transformers form the basis and backbone of any transmission and distribution system of power in a country. Oil cooled transformers are the most preferred choice due to their relatively better efficiency and life compared to other types of transformers.
Transformer insulation used in such oil-cooled equipment is cellulosic material made from pure unbleached kraft wood pulp. These can be in different forms namely, Transformer Insulating Pressboard and Insulation paper.
Given below are different types of Transformer Insulation which are being generally used:
Pre-Compressed Press Board components
Pre-Compressed Press Board components like spacers, ducts, trapezoidal strips, T- strips, blocks, washers or circles, yoke insulation, phase barrier insulation, cylinders, ladders, etc. These are manufactured by machining of transformers insulating pre-compressed pressboards by process of shearing, punching, moulding, rolling, etc. These components are used in coils and inside of the transformer to insulate various active parts from each other and also to facilitate sufficient oil flow between components for cooling.
Transformer insulating kraft paper
Transformer insulating kraft paper comes in thickness from 1.5 mil to 5 mil. It is used for various interlayer applications and also for the covering of aluminum and copper conductors in transformers. They are also made from long virgin fibers of cellulose having high mechanical and electrical strength. The water used for the manufacturing of this paper must be demineralized and of very high purity so that the conductivity of the paper is extremely low.
Transformer insulating pressphan paper
Transformer insulating pressphan paper comes in thickness from 5 mil to 20 mil. This is used in both interlayer applications as well as cylinders in small transformers. The density of this paper is more than Insulating kraft paper as the pressing load is higher in this case. The breakdown voltage of Insulating pressphan paper is also higher compared to all other insulating papers used in oil-cooled transformers.
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper is a variety of transformer insulating kraft paper or pressphan paper on which epoxy resin square dots are impregnated at a certain distance. When this paper is used to make coils and such coils are subjected to heat in ovens to remove excess moisture from transformer parts, the epoxy resin melts above 100 deg C and binds the conductors around it. This is very useful in preventing the dislocation of conductors due to vibrations when the transformer is in operation in the field.
Transformer Insulating crepe paper
Transformer Insulating crepe paper is insulating kraft paper which is creped using a special machine and chemical. This process makes the paper stretchable by up to 80 to 120% of its original length when pulled laterally. Transformer Insulating crepe paper is used in covering lead-outs in power transformers, in covering the core of instrumentation transformers and also in covering of rectangular profile conductors for single-phase transformers.

Impact of Insulating Press board insulation on life of Electrical Transformers
Any electrical transformer is made broadly of two types of components
active parts and
non-active parts
Transformer insulation press boards & insulating papers form one of the non-active parts of oil-cooled electrical transformers. By non-active part, it is meant that there is no flow of current or magnetic induction through the components. Generally, the active part of a transformer can be easily tested when the transformer is made. On the other hand, transformer insulation cannot be tested easily.
Some of the parameters which are important in transformer insulating press boards & insulating papers & which determine the life of it are:
Ageing properties: Good quality transformer insulation will be made of the long virgin fibre of softwood found in cold climatic conditions. These long fibres, when formed into insulating pressboard & paper by the wet-laid process, gives a very tight cohesive binding between its layers. As the fibres are virgin, thus their strength is also uncompromised. This insulation material made from such fibres will have excellent ageing properties, resulting in a long life of transformers.
The purity of fibres: For manufacturing of economical grade of press boards, a certain quantity of secondary fibres are mixed with virgin fibres. These secondary fibres are shorter in length and thus have lower integrity to insulation structure. Such press boards tend to leach out fibres in transformer oil over a period of time, making it impure. Such impure oil will reduce the life of the transformer as oil gradually loses its own properties of acting as a coolant.
Consistency of fibre layering: The main purpose of insulating pressboard is to stop transmission of electricity across itself. It is used in various forms in a transformer – usually spacers, ducts, trapezoidal or key strips, yoke insulation, phase barrier, footplate, cylinders blocks etc. It is important that every component should have consistent fibre layering across it to ensure that there is no weak spot through which electricity passes. This is also known as the breakdown voltage of the insulating material.
All the above three parameters are extremely important in any transformer insulating pressboard to ensure high life of the transformer. The source of such insulation is very important as these parameters can only be tested in specific laboratories and its impact is only known over a period of time.
We at Pristine Technologies & Industries ensure that only the best quality of Electrical Grade insulating press boards manufactured by ABB India Ltd (Erstwhile Raman Boards Ltd) is used in making of components by us. This results in high life & maintenance-free working of your transformers for long durations. Transformer insulation components manufactured by us can be used in distribution and power transformers from 11 KV class to 132 KV class ratings.

Oil cooled transformers form the basis and backbone of any transmission and distribution system of power in a country. Oil cooled transformers are the most preferred choice due to their relatively better efficiency and life compared to other types of transformers.
Transformer insulation used in such oil-cooled equipment is cellulosic material made from pure unbleached kraft wood pulp. These can be in different forms namely, Transformer Insulating Pressboard and Insulation paper.
Given below are different types of Transformer Insulation which are being generally used:
Pre-Compressed Press Board components
Pre-Compressed Press Board components like spacers, ducts, trapezoidal strips, T- strips, blocks, washers or circles, yoke insulation, phase barrier insulation, cylinders, ladders, etc. These are manufactured by machining of transformers insulating pre-compressed pressboards by process of shearing, punching, moulding, rolling, etc. These components are used in coils and inside of the transformer to insulate various active parts from each other and also to facilitate sufficient oil flow between components for cooling.
Transformer insulating kraft paper
Transformer insulating kraft paper comes in thickness from 1.5 mil to 5 mil. It is used for various interlayer applications and also for the covering of aluminum and copper conductors in transformers. They are also made from long virgin fibers of cellulose having high mechanical and electrical strength. The water used for the manufacturing of this paper must be demineralized and of very high purity so that the conductivity of the paper is extremely low.
Transformer insulating pressphan paper
Transformer insulating pressphan paper comes in thickness from 5 mil to 20 mil. This is used in both interlayer applications as well as cylinders in small transformers. The density of this paper is more than Insulating kraft paper as the pressing load is higher in this case. The breakdown voltage of Insulating pressphan paper is also higher compared to all other insulating papers used in oil-cooled transformers.
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper is a variety of transformer insulating kraft paper or pressphan paper on which epoxy resin square dots are impregnated at a certain distance. When this paper is used to make coils and such coils are subjected to heat in ovens to remove excess moisture from transformer parts, the epoxy resin melts above 100 deg C and binds the conductors around it. This is very useful in preventing the dislocation of conductors due to vibrations when the transformer is in operation in the field.
Transformer Insulating crepe paper
Transformer Insulating crepe paper is insulating kraft paper which is creped using a special machine and chemical. This process makes the paper stretchable by up to 80 to 120% of its original length when pulled laterally. Transformer Insulating crepe paper is used in covering lead-outs in power transformers, in covering the core of instrumentation transformers and also in covering of rectangular profile conductors for single-phase transformers.
Pristine Technologies and Industries is one of the major manufacturers of transformer insulation in India and one of the leading transformer insulation suppliers in Bangladesh, Nepal, and other SAARC countries. Pristine Technologies and Industries has established its brand name as Transformer insulation suppliers and exporters by sheer competence, knowledge base and industry experience of more than 35 years by promoters.

Impact of Insulating Press board insulation on life of Electrical Transformers
Any electrical transformer is made broadly of two types of components
active parts and
non-active parts
Transformer insulation press boards & insulating papers form one of the non-active parts of oil-cooled electrical transformers. By non-active part, it is meant that there is no flow of current or magnetic induction through the components. Generally, the active part of a transformer can be easily tested when the transformer is made. On the other hand, transformer insulation cannot be tested easily.
Some of the parameters which are important in transformer insulating press boards & insulating papers & which determine the life of it are:
Ageing properties: Good quality transformer insulation will be made of the long virgin fibre of softwood found in cold climatic conditions. These long fibres, when formed into insulating pressboard & paper by the wet-laid process, gives a very tight cohesive binding between its layers. As the fibres are virgin, thus their strength is also uncompromised. This insulation material made from such fibres will have excellent ageing properties, resulting in a long life of transformers.
The purity of fibres: For manufacturing of economical grade of press boards, a certain quantity of secondary fibres are mixed with virgin fibres. These secondary fibres are shorter in length and thus have lower integrity to insulation structure. Such press boards tend to leach out fibres in transformer oil over a period of time, making it impure. Such impure oil will reduce the life of the transformer as oil gradually loses its own properties of acting as a coolant.
Consistency of fibre layering: The main purpose of insulating pressboard is to stop transmission of electricity across itself. It is used in various forms in a transformer – usually spacers, ducts, trapezoidal or key strips, yoke insulation, phase barrier, footplate, cylinders blocks etc. It is important that every component should have consistent fibre layering across it to ensure that there is no weak spot through which electricity passes. This is also known as the breakdown voltage of the insulating material.
All the above three parameters are extremely important in any transformer insulating pressboard to ensure high life of the transformer. The source of such insulation is very important as these parameters can only be tested in specific laboratories and its impact is only known over a period of time.
We at Pristine Technologies & Industries ensure that only the best quality of Electrical Grade insulating press boards manufactured by ABB India Ltd (Erstwhile Raman Boards Ltd) is used in making of components by us. This results in high life & maintenance-free working of your transformers for long durations. Transformer insulation components manufactured by us can be used in distribution and power transformers from 11 KV class to 132 KV class ratings.

Transformer Insulation for Oil cooled Transformers
Oil cooled transformers form the basis and backbone of any transmission and distribution system of power in a country. Oil cooled transformers are the most preferred choice due to their relatively better efficiency and life compared to other types of transformers.
Transformer insulation used in such oil-cooled equipment is cellulosic material made from pure unbleached kraft wood pulp. These can be in different forms namely, Transformer Insulating Pressboard and Insulation paper.
Given below are different types of Transformer Insulation which are being generally used:
Pre-Compressed Press Board components
Pre-Compressed Press Board components like spacers, ducts, trapezoidal strips, T- strips, blocks, washers or circles, yoke insulation, phase barrier insulation, cylinders, ladders, etc. These are manufactured by machining of transformers insulating pre-compressed pressboards by process of shearing, punching, moulding, rolling, etc. These components are used in coils and inside of the transformer to insulate various active parts from each other and also to facilitate sufficient oil flow between components for cooling.
Transformer insulating kraft paper
Transformer insulating kraft paper comes in thickness from 1.5 mil to 5 mil. It is used for various interlayer applications and also for the covering of aluminum and copper conductors in transformers. They are also made from long virgin fibers of cellulose having high mechanical and electrical strength. The water used for the manufacturing of this paper must be demineralized and of very high purity so that the conductivity of the paper is extremely low.
Transformer insulating pressphan paper
Transformer insulating pressphan paper comes in thickness from 5 mil to 20 mil. This is used in both interlayer applications as well as cylinders in small transformers. The density of this paper is more than Insulating kraft paper as the pressing load is higher in this case. The breakdown voltage of Insulating pressphan paper is also higher compared to all other insulating papers used in oil-cooled transformers.
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper is a variety of transformer insulating kraft paper or pressphan paper on which epoxy resin square dots are impregnated at a certain distance. When this paper is used to make coils and such coils are subjected to heat in ovens to remove excess moisture from transformer parts, the epoxy resin melts above 100 deg C and binds the conductors around it. This is very useful in preventing the dislocation of conductors due to vibrations when the transformer is in operation in the field.
Transformer Insulating crepe paper
Transformer Insulating crepe paper is insulating kraft paper which is creped using a special machine and chemical. This process makes the paper stretchable by up to 80 to 120% of its original length when pulled laterally. Transformer Insulating crepe paper is used in covering lead-outs in power transformers, in covering the core of instrumentation transformers and also in covering of rectangular profile conductors for single-phase transformers.

Impact of Insulating Press board insulation on life of Electrical Transformers
Any electrical transformer is made broadly of two types of components
active parts and
non-active parts
Transformer insulation press boards & insulating papers form one of the non-active parts of oil-cooled electrical transformers. By non-active part, it is meant that there is no flow of current or magnetic induction through the components. Generally, the active part of a transformer can be easily tested when the transformer is made. On the other hand, transformer insulation cannot be tested easily.
Some of the parameters which are important in transformer insulating press boards & insulating papers & which determine the life of it are:
Ageing properties: Good quality transformer insulation will be made of the long virgin fibre of softwood found in cold climatic conditions. These long fibres, when formed into insulating pressboard & paper by the wet-laid process, gives a very tight cohesive binding between its layers. As the fibres are virgin, thus their strength is also uncompromised. This insulation material made from such fibres will have excellent ageing properties, resulting in a long life of transformers.
The purity of fibres: For manufacturing of economical grade of press boards, a certain quantity of secondary fibres are mixed with virgin fibres. These secondary fibres are shorter in length and thus have lower integrity to insulation structure. Such press boards tend to leach out fibres in transformer oil over a period of time, making it impure. Such impure oil will reduce the life of the transformer as oil gradually loses its own properties of acting as a coolant.
Consistency of fibre layering: The main purpose of insulating pressboard is to stop transmission of electricity across itself. It is used in various forms in a transformer – usually spacers, ducts, trapezoidal or key strips, yoke insulation, phase barrier, footplate, cylinders blocks etc. It is important that every component should have consistent fibre layering across it to ensure that there is no weak spot through which electricity passes. This is also known as the breakdown voltage of the insulating material.
All the above three parameters are extremely important in any transformer insulating pressboard to ensure high life of the transformer. The source of such insulation is very important as these parameters can only be tested in specific laboratories and its impact is only known over a period of time.
We at Pristine Technologies & Industries ensure that only the best quality of Electrical Grade insulating press boards manufactured by ABB India Ltd (Erstwhile Raman Boards Ltd) is used in making of components by us. This results in high life & maintenance-free working of your transformers for long durations. Transformer insulation components manufactured by us can be used in distribution and power transformers from 11 KV class to 132 KV class ratings.

Transformer Insulation for Oil cooled Transformers
Oil cooled transformers form the basis and backbone of any transmission and distribution system of power in a country. Oil cooled transformers are the most preferred choice due to their relatively better efficiency and life compared to other types of transformers.
Transformer insulation used in such oil-cooled equipment is cellulosic material made from pure unbleached kraft wood pulp. These can be in different forms namely, Transformer Insulating Pressboard and Insulation paper.
Given below are different types of Transformer Insulation which are being generally used:
Pre-Compressed Press Board components
Pre-Compressed Press Board components like spacers, ducts, trapezoidal strips, T- strips, blocks, washers or circles, yoke insulation, phase barrier insulation, cylinders, ladders, etc. These are manufactured by machining of transformers insulating pre-compressed pressboards by process of shearing, punching, moulding, rolling, etc. These components are used in coils and inside of the transformer to insulate various active parts from each other and also to facilitate sufficient oil flow between components for cooling.
Transformer insulating kraft paper
Transformer insulating kraft paper comes in thickness from 1.5 mil to 5 mil. It is used for various interlayer applications and also for the covering of aluminum and copper conductors in transformers. They are also made from long virgin fibers of cellulose having high mechanical and electrical strength. The water used for the manufacturing of this paper must be demineralized and of very high purity so that the conductivity of the paper is extremely low.
Transformer insulating pressphan paper
Transformer insulating pressphan paper comes in thickness from 5 mil to 20 mil. This is used in both interlayer applications as well as cylinders in small transformers. The density of this paper is more than Insulating kraft paper as the pressing load is higher in this case. The breakdown voltage of Insulating pressphan paper is also higher compared to all other insulating papers used in oil-cooled transformers.
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper
Transformer Insulating Diamond dotted epoxy paper is a variety of transformer insulating kraft paper or pressphan paper on which epoxy resin square dots are impregnated at a certain distance. When this paper is used to make coils and such coils are subjected to heat in ovens to remove excess moisture from transformer parts, the epoxy resin melts above 100 deg C and binds the conductors around it. This is very useful in preventing the dislocation of conductors due to vibrations when the transformer is in operation in the field.
Transformer Insulating crepe paper
Transformer Insulating crepe paper is insulating kraft paper which is creped using a special machine and chemical. This process makes the paper stretchable by up to 80 to 120% of its original length when pulled laterally. Transformer Insulating crepe paper is used in covering lead-outs in power transformers, in covering the core of instrumentation transformers and also in covering of rectangular profile conductors for single-phase transformers.
Pristine Technologies and Industries is one of the major manufacturers of transformer insulation in India and one of the leading transformer insulation suppliers in Bangladesh, Nepal, and other SAARC countries. Pristine Technologies and Industries has established its brand name as Transformer insulation suppliers and exporters by sheer competence, knowledge base and industry experience of more than 35 years by promoters.

Impact of Insulating Press board insulation on life of Electrical Transformers
Any electrical transformer is made broadly of two types of components
active parts and
non-active parts
Transformer insulation press boards & insulating papers form one of the non-active parts of oil-cooled electrical transformers. By non-active part, it is meant that there is no flow of current or magnetic induction through the components. Generally, the active part of a transformer can be easily tested when the transformer is made. On the other hand, transformer insulation cannot be tested easily.
Some of the parameters which are important in transformer insulating press boards & insulating papers & which determine the life of it are:
Ageing properties: Good quality transformer insulation will be made of the long virgin fibre of softwood found in cold climatic conditions. These long fibres, when formed into insulating pressboard & paper by the wet-laid process, gives a very tight cohesive binding between its layers. As the fibres are virgin, thus their strength is also uncompromised. This insulation material made from such fibres will have excellent ageing properties, resulting in a long life of transformers.
The purity of fibres: For manufacturing of economical grade of press boards, a certain quantity of secondary fibres are mixed with virgin fibres. These secondary fibres are shorter in length and thus have lower integrity to insulation structure. Such press boards tend to leach out fibres in transformer oil over a period of time, making it impure. Such impure oil will reduce the life of the transformer as oil gradually loses its own properties of acting as a coolant.
Consistency of fibre layering: The main purpose of insulating pressboard is to stop transmission of electricity across itself. It is used in various forms in a transformer – usually spacers, ducts, trapezoidal or key strips, yoke insulation, phase barrier, footplate, cylinders blocks etc. It is important that every component should have consistent fibre layering across it to ensure that there is no weak spot through which electricity passes. This is also known as the breakdown voltage of the insulating material.
All the above three parameters are extremely important in any transformer insulating pressboard to ensure high life of the transformer. The source of such insulation is very important as these parameters can only be tested in specific laboratories and its impact is only known over a period of time.
We at Pristine Technologies & Industries ensure that only the best quality of Electrical Grade insulating press boards manufactured by ABB India Ltd (Erstwhile Raman Boards Ltd) is used in making of components by us. This results in high life & maintenance-free working of your transformers for long durations. Transformer insulation components manufactured by us can be used in distribution and power transformers from 11 KV class to 132 KV class ratings.
