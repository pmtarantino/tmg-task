There's Only One
There are many brands of welding products. There’s only one Miller.
We make welding solutions that deliver unbeatable dependability, versatility, performance and ease of use for only one reason: to serve welders like you. Ready to find the perfect Miller® solution? There’s a distributor near you who’s ready to help.
There’s never been a better time to choose Miller — because you can enter to win your choice of a new Bobcat™ 260, Millermatic® 255 or Multimatic® 255. Learn how!
Bobcat™ 225 and 260
BOBCAT™ 225:
BOBCAT™ 260:

There’s only one family of welder/generators that reduces jobsite noise and puts up to $1,500 back in your pocket each year.
Take control, reduce noise and lower operating costs with Remote Start/Stop, standard on Bobcat 225 and 260 welder/generators. Easily turn your Bobcat machine on and off remotely, so it only runs when you need it. Get more done with each tank of fuel, extend time between maintenance intervals and work without the hassle of walking back to your machine.
Learn more about these welder/generators in our Q&A livestream event series. Want to win a Bobcat 260? See how to enter.
Millermatic® 255 and Multimatic® 255
MILLERMATIC® 255:
MULTIMATIC® 255:

There’s only one family of 250-amp welders with pulse welding capabilities to cut work time by up to 50%.
Dealing with spatter adds unproductive time to the work day — which means less welding gets done. Minimize spatter with a Millermatic 255 or Multimatic 255. Both machines support pulsed MIG welding for lower heat input and less spatter. That means less post-weld grinding — and less chance of distortion on thin materials too, so there’s less rework.
Learn more about these welders in our Q&A livestream event series. Want to win one? See how to enter.
Product Q&A Livestream Event Series
There’s more than one way to learn about new Miller products — but one of the best ways is to talk to a Miller product specialist! Join us in a series of livestreamed events where we’ll take questions, give answers and show you the industry-leading features that make these machines the only ones you need.

Automation Terms of Sale >>
Terms and Conditions of Sale
1. Acceptance. Miller Electric Mfg Co. (“Miller”) is selling products (“Products”) and/or services (“Services”) and the customer purchasing from Miller is referred to as (“Purchaser”). These terms and conditions of sale (“Terms”), any Miller quotation, acknowledgment or invoice and all documents incorporated by specific reference herein or therein (“Miller Documents”) and together with these Terms, the (“Agreement”), constitute the complete terms governing the sale of Products and Services. MILLER HEREBY REJECTS ANY ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT TERMS OR CONDITIONS PROPOSED BY PURCHASER, WHETHER OR NOT CONTAINED IN ANY OF PURCHASER’S BUSINESS FORMS OR IN PURCHASER’S WEBSITE, AND SUCH ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT TERMS WILL BE OF NO EFFECT. No site usage agreement or any other click through agreement on a website will have any binding effect whether or not Miller clicks on an “ok,” “I accept,” or similar acknowledgment. Commencement of any work by Miller or Purchaser's acceptance of delivery of the Products and/or Services will manifest Purchaser's assent to the Agreement. Additional or different terms applicable to a particular sale may be specified in the body of a Miller Document or agreed to in writing by the parties. In the event of a conflict, the following order of precedence will apply: (a) terms agreed to in writing and executed by an authorized officer of Miller; (b) Miller Document terms; (c) these Terms.
2. Quotations. Quotations are only valid in writing and for 30 days from the date of the quotation. All quotations are subject to change or withdrawal without prior notice to Purchaser. Quotations are made subject to approval of Purchaser’s credit. Miller may refuse orders and has no obligation to supply Products or Services unless Miller issues an order acknowledgement or upon the shipment of Products or commencement of Services.
3. Prices and Payment Terms. Prices are in U.S. Dollars and are subject to change without notice. All purchase orders (“Orders”) are accepted subject to Miller’s price in effect at time of  order. Prices do not include any sales, use, value-added or other taxes, import duties, license fees or like charges (“Fees”) related to the sale, importation or use of Products or Services, and Purchaser is responsible for those Fees. If Miller is subsequently required to pay any Fees, Purchaser shall fully defend and indemnify Miller therefor. Terms of payment are 30 days net from the date of Miller’s invoice. Overdue invoices will incur interest at the rate of 1.5% per month, or at the maximum rate allowable by governing law. Purchaser’s inspection rights herein will not affect the payment terms. Under no circumstances will Purchaser have a right of set-off. If Purchaser fails to make any payment as required, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Miller for all associated costs incurred by Miller, including reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  Minimum order is $50.00 net for domestic shipments.  Non–standard product will be subject to minimum order quantities and lead times as specified by Miller.
4. Credit Approval. All shipments are subject to credit approval by Miller. Miller may invoice Purchaser and recover for each shipment as a separate transaction. If, in Miller’s sole judgment, Purchaser’s financial condition is or becomes unsatisfactory, then Miller may, without prejudice to any of its other remedies: (a) defer or decline to make any shipments except upon receipt of satisfactory security or cash payments in advance; and/or (b) terminate any or all of Purchaser’s purchase orders.
5. Cancellation or Modification. Once Miller has accepted a purchase order or begun taking actions with respect to a purchase order, Purchaser cannot cancel or modify that purchase order except with Miller’s consent. In such event, Purchaser will be liable for cancellation or modification charges and all costs incurred for the order or in connection with the cancellation or modification. No cancellations will be permitted for any sales items.
6. Inspection / Non-Conforming Shipments. Purchaser may inspect Products for a period of 15 business days after delivery (“Inspection Period”). Purchaser must notify Miller in writing of any nonconforming Products within the Inspection Period and afford Miller a reasonable opportunity to inspect such Products and cure any nonconformity. If Purchaser fails to provide Miller such written notice within the Inspection Period, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted the Products. Purchaser may not return any Product without Miller’s prior written authorization. Any return authorized by Miller must be made in accordance with Miller’s return policies. Purchaser will be responsible for all costs associated with returns of Products and will bear the risk of loss, unless Miller agrees otherwise in writing or determines that the Products do not conform to the applicable terms of sale. Any variation in quantities shipped over or under those ordered (not to exceed 10%) will constitute compliance with Purchaser’s order, and the stated price per item will continue to apply.
7. Delivery.  Miller anticipates use of common carriers for shipment of Products. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, all Products will be shipped FOB Miller’s facility (Incoterms 2010). Shipping dates are approximate and are based upon prompt receipt of all necessary information from Purchaser. Miller may ship items in a single or multiple shipments. Title to the Products and risk of loss shall pass to Purchaser upon shipment in accordance with the applicable shipping term. Purchaser assumes all risk and liability for loss and use or misuse by third parties who acquire or use the Products illicitly after delivery. Purchaser must notify Miller and the delivering carrier within  5 days business days from date of receipt of Products, of any damage or shortage, and afford Miller a reasonable opportunity to inspect the Products. Any loss occasioned by damage or shrinkage in transit will be for Purchaser’s account, and claims for such loss must be made solely against the carrier.
8. Warranty. Miller’s warranty terms for the Products is posted at https://www.millerwelds.com/en/support/warranty.
9. Service Warranty. Miller warrants the Services shall conform to any mutually agreed upon specifications or statements of work. Purchaser’s sole remedy, and Miller’s sole liability, for a breach of the foregoing warranty is for Miller, at its option, to re-perform the Services or credit Purchaser’s account for such Services.
10. Limitation of Liability and Remedies. MILLER WILL NOT BE LIABLE, AND PURCHASER WAIVES ALL CLAIMS AGAINST Miller, FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, DOWN TIME, LOST PROFITS OR COMMERCIAL LOSSES, WHETHER OR NOT BASED UPON MILLER’S NEGLIGENCE OR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION. IN NO EVENT WILL MILLER’S LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT OR SALE OF MILLER’S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AS TO WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE.
11. Training.  All users of the Products are required to read and adhere to the applicable user manuals and safety instructions. Purchaser shall indemnify Miller for all costs incurred with respect to claims for personal injuries and property damage in connection with the use of Products by any person without property training. Miller may provide Purchaser with training upon request, provided, however, any training provided by Miller will not affect Purchaser's obligations set forth above.
12. Product Use. Purchaser is solely responsible for determining if a Product is fit for a particular purpose and suitable for Purchaser’s method of application. Accordingly, and due to the nature and manner of use of Miller’s Products, Miller is not responsible for the results or consequences of use, misuse or application of its Products. All physical properties, statements and recommendations are either based on the tests or experience that Miller believes to be reliable, but they are not guaranteed.
13. Ownership of Intellectual Property. All drawings, know-how, designs, specifications, inventions, devices, developments, processes, copyrights and other information or intellectual property disclosed or otherwise provided to Purchaser by Miller and all rights therein (collectively, “Intellectual Property”) will remain the property of Miller and will be kept confidential by Purchaser in accordance with these Terms. Purchaser has no claim to, nor ownership interest in, any Intellectual Property, and such information, in whatever form and any copies thereof, shall be promptly returned to Miller upon request from Miller. Purchaser acknowledges that no license or rights of any sort are granted to Purchaser hereunder in respect of any Intellectual Property, other than the limited right to use Miller’s Products or receive the Services purchased from Miller.
14. Use of Trademarks and Trade Names. Purchaser shall not use, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, Miller’s name, or any other trademark or trade name that is now or may hereafter be owned by Miller (collectively the “Trademarks”), as part of Purchaser’s corporate or business name, or in any way in connection with Purchaser’s business, except in a manner and to the extent authorized herein or otherwise approved by Miller in writing. Purchaser hereby acknowledges Miller’s ownership of the Trademarks and the goodwill associated therewith. Purchaser shall not infringe upon, harm or contest the validity of any Trademarks. Purchaser shall be entitled to use the Trademarks only in connection with the promotion or sale of the Authorized Products pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. Purchaser shall reproduce the Trademarks exactly as specified by Miller. Purchaser shall not use the Trademarks in combination with any other trademarks or names. Purchaser agrees that it will not register or attempt to register any Trademark or any colorable imitation thereof (including any non-English language variation thereof), or use such Trademarks for any products or for any purposes other than those set forth in the Agreement. Purchaser shall not at any time during or after termination of the Agreement use in its business any other trademark that is similar to or in any way resembles the Trademarks so as to be likely to cause deception or confusion with the Trademarks. Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to Miller with respect to any efforts of Miller to protect, defend or enforce its rights to the Trademarks. Should Purchaser cease being an authorized customer of Miller for any reason, Purchaser shall immediately discontinue any formerly permitted use of Miller’s name or the Trademarks.
15. Confidential Information. All information furnished or made available by Miller to Purchaser in connection with the subject matter hereof shall be held in confidence by Purchaser. Purchaser agrees not to use (directly or indirectly), or disclose to others, such information without Miller’s prior written consent. The obligations in this section will not apply to any information that: (a) at the time of disclosure was or thereafter becomes generally available to the public by publication or otherwise through no breach by Purchaser of any obligation herein; (b) Purchaser can show by written records was in Purchaser’s possession prior to disclosure by Miller; or (c) is legally made available to Purchaser by or through a third party having no direct or indirect confidentiality obligation to Miller with respect to such information.
16. Audit. Unless agreed to in writing by an officer of Miller, neither Purchaser nor any Purchaser representative, may examine or audit Miller’s cost accounts, books or records of any kind or any matter, or any other data that Miller, in its sole discretion, considers confidential or proprietary.
17. Infringement and Indemnification. Except as set forth below, Miller agrees to defend and indemnify Purchaser against any claims, costs, damages, liability and expenses resulting from actual patent, trademark or copyright infringement, misappropriation of confidential information, or violation of any other Intellectual Property right, domestic or foreign that may arise from the sale of Miller’s proprietary Product to Purchaser as such pertains to the subject matter of the Agreement (each, a “Claim”); provided, however, (a) Purchaser supplies Miller written notice of such Claim immediately after the Purchaser has notice of such Claim, (b) Purchaser cooperates with Miller in the defense and settlement of such Claim; and (c) Purchaser allows Miller the right to defend and settle such Claim at Miller’s expense If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would prevent Miller from supplying any part or Product falling under the Agreement, or if the result of such a suit or claim would, in the reasonable opinion of Miller, otherwise cause Miller to be unable to supply such parts or Products, Miller may do one or more of the following: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Miller to continue supplying those parts or Products; (ii) modify the appropriate part or Product so that it becomes non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate part or Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent part or Product; or (iv) if Miller cannot reasonably accomplish the actions specified in subsections (i) – (iii), then in Miller’s sole discretion, Miller may discontinue selling the part or Product without any further liability to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Miller shall have no liability or duty to defend and indemnify Purchaser against any Claim relating to: (1) the use of any part or Product, (2) the combination of any part or Product with any other part or product not supplied by Miller, or (3) any part or Product or process that is designed or specified by Purchaser.
18. Miller Employees. Miller sales and service employees do not have the training or authority to make legal representations or enter into any agreements or execute any Purchaser documents affecting legal responsibilities or waiving legal rights, including those regarding the transfer of intellectual property rights or related to privacy laws.

19. Service Terms. The following terms and conditions apply to any on-site Services provided by Miller:
A. Services will be provided at Miller’s then current service rates.
B. Purchaser shall prepare the site for the Services. If the site is not prepared for the Services upon Miller service personnel’s arrival at the agreed upon time and date for Services, Miller may charge Purchaser for any delay and/or travel time at Miller’s regular service rates.

D. Miller may refuse, without any liability, to provide Services and to allow Miller service personnel to suspend Services or vacate any site where, in Miller’s opinion, performance of Services would pose a risk to the safety of any person. In such event, Purchaser is responsible for payment of any delay and/or travel time at Miller’s regular service rates.
E. Purchaser is solely liable for all damages or injuries caused or contributed to by Purchaser that may occur on the site, except to the extent damages or injuries are directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Miller service personnel.

21. Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in the Agreement or the course of dealing of the parties may be construed to constitute the parties hereto as partners, joint venturers or as agents for one another or as authorizing either party to obligate the other in any manner.
22. Force Majeure. Miller will not be responsible for failure to perform in a timely manner under the Agreement when its failure results from events beyond its reasonable control (an event of “Force Majeure”), including acts of God, epidemics, acts of war whether declared or undeclared, blockades, labor disputes (whether of Miller’s employees or the employees of others), raw material shortages and material increases in costs of raw materials. In the event of Force Majeure, the time for performance will extend for such time as reasonably necessary to enable Miller to perform.
23. Assignment; Binding Effect. No assignment of any rights or interest or delegation of any obligation of Purchaser under the Agreement or Purchaser’s purchase order may be made without Miller’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment will be void. Miller may assign the Agreement or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under the Agreement. The Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
24. Waiver. In the event of any default by Purchaser, Miller may decline to ship Products or provide Services. If Miller elects to continue shipping or otherwise fails to insist upon strict compliance with the Agreement, Miller’s actions will not constitute a waiver of Purchaser’s default or any other existing or future default, or affect Miller’s legal remedies.
25. Bankruptcy. If either party becomes insolvent, is unable to pay its debts when due, files for or is the subject of involuntary bankruptcy, has a receiver appointed or has its assets assigned, the other party may cancel any unfulfilled obligations hereunder.
26. Limitation of Actions/Choice of Law/Litigation Costs. Any dispute arising out of or related to the Agreement will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the state of Illinois and litigated exclusively in a state or federal court located in Cook County, Illinois. The parties hereto expressly release and waive any and all rights to a jury trial and consent to have any dispute heard solely by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement. If either party commences litigation or mutually agreed upon alternative dispute resolution concerning any provision of the Agreement, the prevailing party is entitled, in addition to the relief granted, to a reasonable sum for their attorney’s fees in such litigation or mutually agreed upon alternative dispute resolution, provided that if each party prevails in part, such fees will be allocated in the manner as the court or arbitrator determines to be equitable in view of the relative merits and amounts of the parties’ claims.
27. Survival. Any provisions in the Agreement which, by their nature, extend beyond the termination or expiration of any sale of Products or Services, will remain in effect until fulfilled.
28. Severability. If any provision herein is held to be unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining provisions herein will remain in effect.
29. Integration and Modification.

Featured Stories:
The Real Cost of Missed or Defective Welds
The goal of any welding operation is to create quality products for customers, while also managing costs and maintaining the desired levels of productivity. Missed or defective welds can have a negative impact on a welding operation, leading to potential safety issues and a loss of revenue for addressing failures or liability claims. Detecting those problems early in the welding operation is vital — and welding information management systems can help.
Welding Robots Can Offer Benefits for Smaller Shops
Robotic welding is no longer just for large manufacturers. See how smaller shops are taking advantage of welding robots.
Ways to Increase Arc-On Time and Throughput in the Welding Operation
Advanced welding information management systems can help companies increase the time spent welding, but just as importantly, they can also give companies the ability to analyze and reduce downtime, and evaluate non-welding activities. Combined, this functionality can lead to greater efficiencies in the welding operation and the production of more parts in less time.

OSHA Controls for Weld Fume Management
When you take a proactive approach to providing a clean, comfortable and compliant work environment, not only will you attract and retain valuable talent but there’s a good chance you’ll experience better weld quality and improved productivity.
Where should you start? Having the air quality in your welding environment assessed to understand the level of airborne contaminants is the first step. Based on those results, you can determine an effective action plan that follows OSHA’s hierarchy for weld fume control.
Miller® and ITW welding products help make it easier and less complicated by offering solutions at every level of the OSHA hierarchy.
Assess Your Air Quality
How do you know if you need to take action?
The first step is to have a certified industrial hygienist perform a worksite analysis to find out what jobs and work stations are potential problems and make recommendations to correct those areas. The hygienist will then test the air in your facility to make sure contaminant levels fall within exposure limits outlined by OSHA or other applicable government occupational limits, whichever is lower.
Any time there is a change to the worker, process or facility, retesting should be conducted to ensure exposure concentrations have not been affected.

Locate Industrial Hygienist
Determine Your Action Plan
Based on the results of your air quality and worksite assessment, you may need to implement controls to create a cleaner, more comfortable work environment and decrease compliance risks.
To determine your action plan, follow the OSHA hierarchy for weld fume control. To make this process easier and more efficient, Miller and ITW welding products have solutions for every level. Contact a Miller Safety Solutions Manager to help guide you through your next steps.
