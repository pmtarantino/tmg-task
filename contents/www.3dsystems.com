DICOM to PRINT
DICOM 3D Model Software
FDA 510(K)-cleared D2P® (DICOM to PRINT) software and 3D Systems printers allow surgeons, radiologists, lab technicians, and device designers to create diagnostic-quality digital 3D models and physical 3D prints easily and quickly.
Request a Free Trial
Minimizing the need for technical expertise, D2P eases the adoption of 3D printing technologies by the healthcare community.
DICOM images are imported into the D2P stand-alone modular software package that consolidates all 3D model segmentation and preparation steps into one workstation. D2P is a cleared medical device intended for pre-operative surgical planning and the production of 3D-printed anatomic models for diagnostic purposes.
The unique image segmentation tool set and its advanced virtual reality (VR) visualization allow clinicians and point-of-care (POC) staff to minimize the effort and time associated with the creation of patient-specific anatomic models.
Digital models exported from the D2P software can be used in a wide variety of applications including 3D printers, VR devices, surgical planning software, and CAD software.
3D Systems is the only manufacturer to offer its own 3D printers and software for cleared, diagnostic-quality models.
While D2P will export digital files compatible with 3D printers from most manufacturers, the combination of D2P and 3D Systems printers offers a 510(K)-cleared solution that allows users to 3D print diagnostic-quality models. When printed using selected materials, these 3D models can be sterilized and are biocompatible. See the D2P regulatory information page for more information on the cleared printers and materials.
3D Systems offers the largest range of 3D printing technologies cleared for manufacture of diagnostic-quality physical models across the widest range of medical specialties.
Buying software and hardware from a single source gives you peace of mind that software and hardware is guaranteed to work together.

Durable Goods
Advanced flight platforms are placing pressure on aerospace companies to adopt rapid manufacturing technologies that accelerate the supply chain and encourage innovation at every level, including product development, inspection and MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul). At the same time, there's a growing need to lower fuel costs and efficiently replace legacy parts for aging fleets.
Aerospace and defense customers leverage 3D Systems' industry-leading solutions and expertise to deliver unprecedented manufacturing productivity improvements: increased speed and reliability of quality assurance and validation processes; lowered fuel costs through lightweighting and parts consolidation; increased manufacturing productivity through innovative 3D printed casting patterns, 3D data recovery, injection-mold design, and direct metal printing of airworthy parts.
The Challenge
Optimizing Parts and Assemblies to Revolutionize Space Exploration
Low-cost robotic space exploration requires throwing away the book on many traditional processes, starting with design and manufacturing.
The Solution
Planetary Resources Uses QuickCast to Achieve New Level of Design Freedom
Patented 3D Systems technologies deliver lighter-weight parts, quicker design iterations, and cost savings from consolidating assemblies into one casted part.

The Challenge
Reconnecting Design With As-Built for NASA's Apollo F-1 Rocket Engine
Although some blueprints of the original F-1 engine design exist, the basic drawings that were available revealed a disconnect between the original design and as-built results.
The Solution
ShapeFidelity Uses Geomagic Software to Accurately Reverse Engineer the F-1
An accurate 3D model of the F-1 engine can now be used for analysis, flow path definition, clearances, and re-creation and manufacturing of the original parts using new materials.

Durable Goods
The quest to out-innovate competitors and reduce costs for every aspect of product development are business as usual in the automotive industry. These demands are complicated by factors such as stricter environmental regulations, rising costs of raw materials, and the ongoing need to reduce time-to-market.
3D Systems has unparalleled experience in addressing the challenges of the automotive industry. Our hardware, software and services solutions are helping companies develop lighter weight parts to drive down manufacturing costs, design and produce innovative assemblies that reduce part counts and provide greater strength and efficiency, and create realistic prototypes that can remove months from the product development process.
The Challenge
Making Product Parts Faster Than With Traditional Casting
English Racing designed an innovative new underdrive pulley gear that would lower oil pressure. But producing it with traditional casting would be too time consuming and cost prohibitive.
