AcoustaSeal
Acousta seals are a semi-closed cell, polyurethane foam manufactured by Acoustafoam to create seals.
Acousta Seal
Modern sealing requirements need innovative materials. Acoustafoam has introduced a new technical foam with a semi-closed cell structure that is ideal for sealing areas from noise, liquids,  amp, gases and also dust. All of these elements must not be allowed to penetrate the joint. The sealing solution must ensure that the seal is secure enough to prevent any level of ingress.  The AcoustaSeal is the perfect material to use when there is a variance in the product build. As the seal can adjust to a range of heights along the total area of the joint.
AcoustaSeal is manufactured in blocks 2000MM x 1000MM x 500MM
Colour = Dark Grey.
Densities = 25, 30, 40, 50kg per cubic metre
Burn rate = FMVSS-302
AcoustaAqua Seal– is a more advanced grade of 30kg density moulded in the same size block 2000MM x 1000MM x 500MM.
This grade has been developed with a smaller cell structure that gives an even better seal allowing us to manufacture seals that need up to 40% less compression so giving material saving cost advantages.  AcoustaSeal is supplied in sheet, strips, cut and CNC profiles. Self-adhesive on any face areas and additional facing materials or RAL colour painted to customer requirements.

Packaging Foam
Acoustafoam offers a wide range of polyethene foams fabricated to provide substantial cushioning within packaging applications. Our packaging foam is engineered foam that can be CNC cut, routered and heat welded to precise customer specifications. The product is fully recyclable and provides repeated impact protection.
Available in anti-static quality and a range of colours, densities and a range of profiled foams cut to size and thickness. Anti-static foam is polyfoam or polyethene foam materials treated, to render them non-conductive to the adverse effects of static electricity.
Our high load bearing packaging open cell foams are a low-cost solution to your packing requirements. Available colours are dark grey, blue, pink anti-static. Due to our production processes, most projects are cut with no tooling costs allowing us to cater for low volume production orders.
Polyethene foam case inserts provide superior protection and unparalleled durability for the interior of your case.
Polyethene foam is a lightweight material that is inherently non-abrasive, non-dusting and easy to fabricate. Polyethene foam case inserts provide superior shock absorption and vibration dampening properties and impervious to bacteria, mildew and mould.
Polyethene foam case inserts have a high load bearing capacity, which helps end users reduce costs due to using less material without sacrificing protection. Great insulation properties along with a high resistance to chemicals and solvents make it an ideal choice for packaging heavier items and for materials handling applications. Polyurethane foam is also known as PU, PUF or PUR. It is a flexible open cell type of foam. Polyurethane foam case inserts provide the best value for lightweight, delicate objects with high fragility. Case inserts are widely used in the medical packaging industry as well as other applications where abrasion resistance is essential.

Cork is an incredibly versatile natural material. Cork is harvested from living cork oak trees, somewhat like wool is gathered from sheep. The trees are unharmed by the process, and they continue producing cork for an average of 150 years.
Background history of Cork
Cork is composed of dead cells that accumulate on the outer surface of the cork oak tree. Because of its honeycomb-like structure, cork consists mostly of empty space; its density (weight per unit volume) is one-fourth that of water. Unlike a honeycomb, however, cork consists of irregularly shaped and spaced cells having an average of 14 sides. With 625 million of these empty cells per cubic inch (40 million per cubic centimetre), cork is like many layers of microscopic Bubble Wrap, making it an effective cushioning material. Its low density makes cork useful in products like life preservers and buoys. A significant amount of dead-air space makes cork an effective insulation material for both temperature and noise. Furthermore, it is fire retardant; flames will only char the surface, and no toxic fumes are generated. By cutting the surface of cork, it turns many of the microscopic cells into tiny suction cups, creating an effective non-slip surface. In addition to being flexible, cork is highly resilient. After being crushed under a pressure of 14,000 lbs/in2 (96,000 kPa), the cork will regain 90% of its original size in 24 hours. Cork absorbs neither dust nor moisture, and it resists both rot and insects. Highly resistant to wear, it is used for polishing diamonds.
Among the many products made from cork are flooring materials (e.g., linoleum), shoe insoles, roofing panels, gaskets, safety helmet liners, bottle stoppers, dartboards, bulletin boards, and cores for golf balls and baseballs. Numerous artificial materials have been developed to substitute for cork in specific applications (e.g., a synthetic pea in a referee’s whistle, foam insoles for shoes, or Styrofoam life preservers). However, no generic substitute has been developed for cork that can be used in diverse applications.
A great deal of the cork harvest was wasted until around 1890 when a German company developed a process for adding a clay binder to cork particles and producing sheets of agglomerated (composite) cork for use as insulation. The following year, an American named John Smith developed a technique for producing pure-cork agglomeration out of waste material by subjecting cork particles to heat and pressure without adding any binder. The next significant development occurred in 1909 when Charles McManus invented a type of agglomerated cork that could be used to line crown caps. Since then, many other techniques have been developed to produce cork compounds with a variety of properties and uses. The raw material for cork products is harvested from the cork oak tree (either the evergreen Quercus suber or the deciduous-Quercus occidentalis). The trees typically reach a height of 40-60 ft. (12-18 m) and a trunk circumference of 6-10 ft. (2-3 m). Virtually all of the world’s commercial cork trees grow in the western Mediterranean region and the Iberian Peninsula. Portugal’s cork forests are the most productive. Accounting for 30% of the existing trees, they produce half of the world’s harvested cork. A cork tree is ready for its first harvest when it is about 20 years old. The first harvest is of poor quality, and can only be used to make agglomerated cork products. Subsequent harvests occur at nine-year intervals when the cork layer reaches a thickness of 1-2 in (2-5 cm). The crop from a young tree yield is about 35 lb (16 kg) of cork while the yield for an older tree may be 500 lb (225 kg). Each tree has a productive life of about 150 years.
During the production of bottle stoppers, chemical baths are used to condition the corks. Among the more popular area chlorinated lime bath followed by a neutralising bath of oxalic acid, a hypochlorite bath neutralised by sodium oxalate, and a peroxide bath neutralised with citric acid.
Production of compound agglomerated cork involves adding a binder or adhesive agent to cork granules. Different binders are chosen, depending on the qualities desired in the ultimate product (e.g., flexibility, softness, resistance to wear). Among those frequently used are asphalt, rubber, gypsum, glue, and plastic. Cork has been used since antiquity as a stopper for bottles because of its compressive abilities. During the Renaissance, cork stoppers were commonplace, and cork-oak trees were grown and processed in the Pyrenees Mountains especially for this purpose. Wine bottles were commonly sealed with oiled hemp. When Pierre Perignon (1638-1715) invented champagne in 1688, he found that the gaseous pressure inside his bottles blew out the hemp stoppers. To solve the problem, he created corks held in place by wire.
The modern metal bottle cap was developed by the prolific Maryland inventor William Painter, who patented his first stopper in 1885. By 1891, his final design, a cork-lined metal cap with a corrugated edge that is crimped around the bottle lip, appeared. Painter called his invention the “crown cap,” founded the Crown Cork and Seal Company to market it, and became very wealthy from it.
The crown cap was the industry standard for nearly 80 years. In 1955, the crown cap’s cork liner was replaced by plastic, and a high-speed machine to inspect crown seals was introduced in 1958. In the 1960s, the Coca-Cola company offered lift-top crown caps. The push-on, twist-off cap was first developed for baby food. Screw caps for carbonated beverages appeared in the 1960s and 1970s and are the standard today. Using a specially designed hatchet, the harvester slices through the cork layer on the trunk of the tree, taking care not to cut deep enough to damage the living portion of the trunk. Horizontal cuts are made at the base of the trunk and just below the lowest branches. A few vertical cuts separate the circumferential cork ring into sections of an appropriate size. Using the wedge-shaped handle of the hatchet, the harvester strips each panel of cork from the tree. On some large trees, cork is also removed from the lower branches.
The cork planks are stacked outdoors and left to cure for a time ranging from a few weeks to six months. The fresh air, the sun, and rain encourage chemical changes that improve the quality of the cork. By the end of the curing process, the planks have flattened out and lost about 20% of their original moisture content.
The planks are then treated with heat and water to remove dirt and water-soluble components like tannin, and to make the cork softer and more flexible. This process typically involves lowering stacks of cork planks into large copper vats filled with boiling water containing a fungicide. Heavyweights are placed on top of the cork to keep it submerged for 30-75 minutes.
When the planks are removed from the vat, a hoe-shaped knife is used to scrape off the poor-quality outer layer of cork, which amounts to about 2% of the volume of the plank but 20% of its weight. The planks are stacked in a dark cellar and allowed to dry and cure under controlled humidity for a few more weeks. The cork planks are trimmed to a uniform, rectangular shape and are sorted by quality. The finest quality material will be used to make natural cork products like wine bottle stoppers. The poorer quality material will be ground and used to make composition or agglomerated cork.
Cork slabs of the desired thickness are placed in a steam chamber for 20 minutes to soften them. The slabs are then cut into strips whose width corresponds to the intended length of the bottle stoppers. The strips are fed through a machine that punches hollow metal tubes through them, removing cylinders of cork.
Although some beverage bottlers want cylindrical corks, others want tapered ones. To achieve this shape, the cylinders are arranged on a slanted conveyor that carries them past a rapidly rotating circular knife. As they pass the blade, the corks are also revolving on the conveyor, so they are trimmed to a taper.
Both cylindrical and tapered corks are washed, bleached, and sterilised in large vats. Rotating wooden paddles continually push the corks down into first a washing solution and then a neutralising solution.
After being dried in a large centrifugal dryer, the corks may be marked with an identifying label (with ink or a hot metal stamp). Some are also coated with a sealant such as paraffin or silicone. Then, they are packed in airtight bags in quantities of 1,000 or 1,500; the air is removed from the bags and replaced with sulphur dioxide (SO2) to keep the corks sterile.
Waste cork is passed through a machine that breaks it into small pieces. The pieces are washed and dried and then sent through two successive grinders to reduce the particle size further. After another washing and drying process, the particles are screened for uniform size.
Pure agglomerated cork is formed by packing cork particles into a mould and covering it securely. Superheated steam (600° F or 315° C) is passed through the mould. Alternatively, the mould is baked at 500° F (260° C) for four to six hours. Either process binds the cork particles into a solid block by activating their natural resins.
Cork intended to be used as bottle corks is first softened by steam and then cut into strips. Next, the strips are fed through a machine that punches hollow metal tubes through them, removing cylinders of cork. Compound agglomerated, or composition, cork is made by uniformly coating the cork granules with a thin layer of an additional adhesive agent. The coated granules are pressed into a mould and slowly heated (the temperature varies, depending on the adhesive used). When removed from the mould and cooled, the blocks are stacked to allow air circulation and are allowed to season.
The agglomerated cork is cut for its intended use. For example, sheets may be cut from rectangular blocks. Or if a tubular mould was used, the resulting cork rod may be sliced into discs. A large, cylindrical block might by revolved against a knife blade to shave it into a long, continuous sheet that is rewound into a roll. Cork waste generated during the manufacturing process is ground and used to make agglomerated cork products. Cork powder that is produced by the grinding process is collected and burned to help fuel the factory. Chemical components removed from cork during its processing can be recovered as useful by-products and include tannin, hard wax, resinous gum, and phonic acid.

Laser Cutting.
Laser cutting is a technology that has been used in industry since the 1970’s. The first common application was for sign-making, mainly cutting acrylic. Since then the process has been adopted and adapted by virtually every industry group. It is now a significant process in across all manufacturing platforms.
Laser cutting is a manufacturing process which can eliminate the need for machining on many engineering jobs. Enabling you to save money on project costs.
The precision levels and edge quality achieved with laser cutting machines are better than traditional cutting methods. This is due to the laser beam not wearing during the cutting process. This technology also allows us to cut complex shapes without the need for tooling and at a similar or faster speed than other cutting methods
The fact that laser cutting technology offers reduced contamination of the workpiece presents certain advantages over traditional mechanical cutting techniques.
Laser cutting also allows us to cut small diameter holes with complex detail and good edge quality in either sheet, plate, tube or box section.
In comparison with punching, it gives a superior edge finish that requires no de-burring or finishing.
Intricate detail & marking potential.
Lasers can cut complex shapes without the need for tooling.
Speed is comparable or faster than other profile cutting methods.
Localised heat distortion is reduced.

Anechoic Chambers.
Anechoic Chamber.
What is an Anechoic Chamber?
An Anechoic chamber is a room where the walls, ceiling and floor are lined with a sound absorbent foam to minimise noise being reflected. Research anechoic chambers are lined with sound absorption wedges whose shape enables free-field conditions.
The anechoic chambers are constructed as a room within a room. The outer walls are 330mm thick, and the inner room is made up of metallic panels mounted on a floating floor. This results in a low noise environment as the outside sound pressure levels are below the threshold of hearing. The chamber is equipped with a Sound Level Meter and Laryngograph to record data.
“Anechoic” means non-reflective, non-echoing or echo-free. The Anechoic chambers along with the internal insulation are also insulated from external noise sources. The combination of both aspects creates the acoustic environment suitable to conduct acoustic research. As the outer insulation prevents interference from external noise sources which may lead to false reading.
Anechoic chambers come in all shapes and sizes. From small cubicles the size of a microwave to ones as large as aircraft hangars. The size of the chamber is dependent on the size of the items being tested and the frequency range of the signals used.  Scale models can be used by testing at higher frequencies.
What are Anechoic Chambers used for?
Anechoic chambers are typically used in acoustics to conduct research. All sound energy will be travelling away from a noise source with almost none reflected back. Typical Anechoic chamber experiments include measuring the transfer function of a loudspeaker or the directivity of sound radiation from industrial machinery. Regularly used in the development of automotive, construction and military vehicles.
In general, the interior of an Anechoic chamber is very quiet, with typical noise levels in the 10–20 dBA range.  Microsoft broke the world record in 2015 with a measurement of -20.6 dBA. Humans can typically hear sounds above 0 dBA. As a result, a human would think the surroundings in an Anechoic chamber to be void of sound. Many people who have visited such chambers say that the lack of sound is uncomfortable and disorientating.
We offer materials.
We offer a choice of materials to create you own unique and spectacular Anechoic chamber. We cut our materials to order using waterjet cutting and CNC Cutting machines allowing us to reduce waste and maximise yield.  We also provide a self-adhesive backing to ease installation saving you time by speeding up the installation process. To top it all off, we can increase the surface area of your chosen foam by profiling the foam. As a result, this increases the amount of sound absorption through the increase in surface area.
The primary acoustic foams available  A01 and A72.

Flexible Polyurethane foam.
Class A Sound Absorber.
Dark Grey.
24KG/M3
A72.

Floor mats – Polyurethane.
Polyurethane is one of the most versatile plastic materials. The nature of the chemistry allows polyurethanes to be adapted to solve challenging problems. Acoustafoam uses this range of materials to mould unusual shapes and to enhance industrial modern design demands within Floor mats.
Acoustafoam has used polyurethane technology for more than 30 years to manufacture Polyurethane Floor Mats for the agricultural, construction, military and industrial vehicles cab environment.
These floor mats can be coloured to match to the vehicle interiors and moulded into almost any three-dimensional profile.
The use of high and low-pressure dispensing machines, liquid polyurethane is injected into a dedicated mould.  Low volume mouldings are made from GRP tools, and high volume mouldings are made from aluminium tools which are hydraulically operated. Heating is also used to reduce cycle times. The material is injected into the moulds as a liquid so the part thickness can be varied. One of the benefits of polyurethanes over conventional rubber mats is its increased acoustic performances.
Solid Polyurethane.
Acoustafoam uses a range of closed cell foams that can be integrally moulded (during the process), into the floor mat to reduce vibration translated through the mat and act as an acoustic decoupler. Polyurethane elastomers are polymers with terrific resistance to abrasion and solvents. These type of elastomers are non-cellular, non-expanding systems. Solid polyurethanes are used for manufacturing heavy duty, wear resistant components with no weight restrictions.
Acoustafoam has advanced technology blending methods that allow us to add fillers and increase the weight by up to 50% of a component. However, it increases the acoustic values of adding a heavy floor mat.
Acoustafoam produces floor mats for a range of small and large companies and ship products throughout the UK, Europe and other international destinations.

Filter Foam
Filter Foam Products.
Our Filter Foam range of products are used as inlet air filters and engine breather filters; the skeletal structure of cells provides a controlled structure which ensures controlled flow rates can be maintained throughout the filters life.
A process known as reticulation is where the magic happens. This creates the open and breathable structure that makes Filter Foam such a flexible filtration material.
We provide a broad range of Filter foams in a large choice of colours and pours per Inch (PPI) ranging from 10PPI to 80PPI. The number of PPI is unique to the level of filtration required. Our choice of filtration foams can be used in their natural state or can be impregnated to make it Flame retardant.
The filter foams available are broken down into four groups depending on their purpose;
EsterCell is our non-FR range and is used as a lower cost option where a fire is not a risk, and there is no contact with water. Perfect for outdoor areas and small components with no fire hazards. For example, for filtration on compressor and generators.
EsterCell FR range which is our Flame-retardant filter foam is best suited for environments containing gas, oil and fumes within Industrial filtration.
EtherCell. Filter foam for water contact applications such as fish filtration and cushions in an outdoor environment that may become wet.
FireCell. A class ‘O’ range of impregnated filter foams which are UL 94/HF1 and BS 476 Class O fire rated.

Acoustafoams Eco-footprint.
Here at Acoustafoam Limited, we are committed to reducing our Eco footprint by applying an Energy Saving and Waste Management program.  To help us guide and develop our plan we have assembled a team from all levels of the company. The team meets every month to discuss all areas of energy saving and waste management affecting our Eco-footprint, to review how we can improve our plan and maintain what is working well.
At Acoustafoam Limited we are committed to the maintenance of an environmental management system to BS EN ISO 14001: 1996 standards through staff training, monitoring manufacturing processes, as well as having good working practice with our suppliers.
To help reduce our Eco-footprint we agree to:
Minimum and returnable packaging of raw materials.
All other packaging is salvaged and reused.
The paper is recycled. Plus we are always looking at ways to go paper light or paper free within the administration.
To Reduce our Carbon footprint by including Customers in logistic recycling to minimise transportation.
Part of our management review meetings is to monitor waste and invest to reduce the amount we create. With the investment in new technology, Acoustafoam Limited has managed to eliminate more than 50 tonnes of solvents per year from our raw material usage.
Acoustafoam Limited strive to become market leaders in Energy saving and Waste management within our field. We believe with our employee training program and investment in technology, the company will meet our objectives.
To meet our Eco footprint objectives the company policy is to have total employee involvement with; production, Eco-footprint issues, health & safety, product quality, working environment, performance and customer needs.

Home / Products / Laminates
Laminates
Lamination is the technique of manufacturing a material in multiple layers, so that the composite material achieves improved strength, stability, sound insulation, appearance or other properties from the use of differing materials.
A laminate is usually permanently assembled by heat, pressure, welding or adhesives. At Acoustafoam we understand that every application of our product offering differs, therefore we offer the service of adding a laminate to any foam we sell.
Laminates that we offer:
Polyurethane (PU).
Polyurethane is a resilient, flexible and durable manufactured material that can take the place of paint, cotton, rubber, metal or wood in thousands of applications across virtually all fields. It can be hard like fibreglass, squishy like upholstery foam, protective like varnish, bouncy like rubber or sticky like glue. PU seals surfaces such as wood, metal and paint to protect them from rot, corrosion or fading. As an adhesive, polyurethane resists moisture and heat, so it is ideal for use in the sun or underwater. It also insulates walls, temperature-controlled vehicles and consumer coolers.
PU laminate is available in white or black and is applied via a laminator which heats the PU film onto the foam.
Foil Faced
Foil faced materials are ideally used to stop vapour or moisture whilst they reduce heat loss through radiation and reflects any extra heat from another source.
Our foil faced laminate is Class O certified.
Felt
Felt can be made of natural fibres such as wool or synthetic such as acrylic by matting, condensing and pressing fibres together. Felt is made by a process called wet felting where the natural wool fibres, stimulated by friction and lubricated by moisture, move at a 90-degree angle towards the friction source and then away again, in effect making little ‘tacking’ stitches. While at any given moment only 5% of the fibres are active, the process is continual, so different ‘sets’ of fibres become activated and then deactivated, thereby building up the cloth. We are able to offer felt in fire retardant and non-retardant.
Polymeric Barrier
A vinyl sound barrier mat loaded with naturally occurring minerals. The Product is free of lead, unrefined aromatic oils and bitumen to improve the sound insulation of existing panels at all frequencies. They are effective in overcoming coincidence dip resonance found in stiff lightweight composites such as plywood sheets and hollow core panels.
There are 3 densities available: 3, 5 and 10 Kg/m2.
Glass Fibre
Glass fibre is commonly used as an insulating material. It is also used as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products; to form a very strong and light fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite material called glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). Glass fibre has roughly comparable properties to other fibres such as polymers and carbon fibre. Glass fibre is also known as needle mat as it offers uniform thickness and density, high temperature performance up to 650 degrees and contains no binders. The properties of the glass fibre are excellent thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures, non-toxic and exceptional sound absorption properties. Uses of regular glass fibre include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, electrical insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat and corrosion-resistant fabrics.
Aluminium Coated Glass Fibre
Using a special adhesive to cover fibre cloth with aluminium foil leaves the product with an even and smooth surface. It is with high reflectivity, high tensile strength, good sealing performance, airtight, heat insulator, sound absorbent and waterproof. The applications are shells of air conditioner and water heaters along with protective coatings for water and ventilating pipes.

Industrial acoustics
Noise in the workplace is a problem within most manufacturing plants. Acoustafoam limited manufacture a vast range of industrial acoustics solutions to solve these problems without affecting production.
With to the introduction of new health and safety regulations, the consideration of noise control within manufacturing plants has become more and more important. Employees cannot be subject to high levels of noise due to this causing long-term hearing damage.
Acoustafoam Limited offers a range of both products and services to assist with noise issues within the workplace which are both are unbeatable services. On-site surveys and noise, testing reports are offered by us to assess the current working environment. This will then allow us to identify the product perfect for you. We can supply, design and fit a broad range of products such as hanging and wall mounted absorbers, acoustic screens, machinery noise panels, anti-vibration pads and acoustic enclosures.
Acoustic pods designed to any size and shape. These may be placed in offices or on the production floor. The advantage of pods is that they can be moved easily as production flows change.
Many of our customers are now having printed absorbers, using the product to display information and safety signage thus making good use of the area treated for noise control.

Home / Heated Pressed Parts.
Heated Pressed Parts.
Here at Acoustafoam, we are always looking for latest Sound control solutions. We have recently developed our latest range of  Heated Pressed Parts. We have two cutting-edge materials Melamine and Phenolic resin fibre to create our 2D elements.
Melamine Foam.
Our Thermoformable Melamine foam is also known as A74 is an open cell thermoformable lend itself to creating a unique acoustic solution. The fundamental properties of melamine foam are;
Flame resistance (without the addition of flame retardants)
Application temperature up to 240°C,
Constant physical properties over a wide temperature range,
Abrasiveness.
Plus the addition of the Open cell structure:
High sound absorption capacity
Lightweight
Excellent thermal insulation properties
Flexibility at very low temperatures.
A74 contains all these significant characteristics with the added benefit of being thermoformable without the additional impregnation steps passing on the cost savings to our customers. By using A74, we have created two technical products MelaForm™ and MelaFoil™.
MelaForm™
MelaForm™ is A74 wrapped in felt which is cured off at >200°C to produce 3D shaped components. Thes components are perfect for under the bonnet and in-cab Sound and thermal insulation. The reason being they can be shaped and designed to overcome complex environments. The additional benefit of MelaForm™ is its ability to apply company logos or patterns to the final design during the heated press process.
MelaFoil™
MelaFoil™ is A74 with a perforated aluminium foil face making it a perfect product for heat shields within in engine blocks and any heat sensitive areas. Through the application of the perforated aluminium, we have increased the thermal value of the product however due to the perforation we have kept the ability of sound absorption. Resulting in there having to be no compromise in sound absorption.
Phenolic Resin Fibre.
Phenolic Resin Fibre is also Known as F33 is a Glass wool Blanket impregnated with formophenolic binders. F33 has improved acoustic comfort due to its excellent sound absorption and sound insulation properties after moulding.
The Key Charaterrists of F33 are:
Optimal Acoustic Performance
Non-Combustible meets Horizontal combustibility and trucks afterglow standards
Excellent Thermal Insulation
Unique Lightness
Sustains up to 230°C operating temperatures
Active Environmental Protection
FibreForm™
FibreForm™ is an F33 and felt composite allowing you to design a creative solution to your acoustic and thermal needs. F33 is an excellent barrier against heat loss, maintaining the right temperature to optimise engine performance and reduce CO2 Emissions. Making FibreForm™ Perfect for hood liners, battery covers, Headliners, Door panel and dash outer insulations.
FibreFoil™
FibreFoil™ is F33 and perforated Foil composite with the additional aluminium foil barrier we can increase the maximum operating temperature. Without decreasing the acoustic performance of the FibreFoil™. A great product to insulate industrial generators, compressors, engine bays and Marine Engines.
MelaForm™, MelaFoil™, FibreForm™  and FibreFoil™ can all be supplied with standard and high-temperature adhesives. The additional Self-adhesive makes the installation process quicker and easier, Increasing your production speed.
