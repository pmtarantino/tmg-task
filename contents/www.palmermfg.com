Foundry Products:
HCCL-Series Heater / Cooler / Classifier
General
The process of controlled heating, cooling, and
classification of sand passing through this unit is achieved by the balanced
use of air from a supplied blower and heated or cooled water in the form of
a heat exchanger bundled designed integrally in the unit. This ensures that
the sand being discharged from the unit is not only at the temperature best
suited to the customer’s operation, but is also free of dust and matches the
desired grain distribution of the sand.
Mechanical Components
The HCCL-Series classifier is constructed from
four major components:
A base, or plenum chamber, into which
fluidizing air is supplied by a blower.
A fluidizing deck
A heat exchanger bundle.
A main body, which serves as a cover and
pressure chamber
The plenum chamber serves not only as
a base, but also a means of distributing the incoming air to the
underside of the fluidizing deck. The deck is an abrasion resistant
steel plate containing self-cleaning orifices through which the air
is passed through in order to fluidize the sand resting on it. The
fluidization orifices are covered with abrasion strips which prevent
sand from falling into the plenum. The fluidization action brings
each grain of sand in intimate contact with the heat exchange
bundle, which is mounted on top of the fluidizing deck and is made
up of steel tubing mounted in close proximity between two water
manifolds. The main body is mounted on top of the base (plenum
chamber) and over the heat exchanger bundle. It serves not only as a
cover, but also as a heating and classifying chamber.
The fluidizing action of the sand not
only contributes to heating and cooling, but also polishes each
grain, removing the dust and fines that exist naturally in the sand
source as well as those created in the transportation of the sand to
the HCCL. A negative pressure maintained over the bed by a dust
collector (supplied by the customer or as an option) and controlled
by a dam gate located between the dust collector and the
heater/cooler/classifier ensures that all the dust and fines are
removed from the chamber and around the sand grains.
Fluidizing air is provided by a
constant pressure blower driven by a TEFC motor that includes an
inlet damper control. Inspection and cleaning panels, flanged
discharge, dust collection, and air manifold connections are
included. The fluidizing air blower can be mounted on either side of
the heater/classifier to suit the customer’s layout.
Sand throughput is regulated using a
high quality butterfly style inlet valve. This valve actuates at the
initiation of the cycle to meter sand into the unit. The concept of
fluidization imparts that for every pound of sand poured into the
unit, one pound will come out. The purpose of this valve is not only
to meter the sand, but also to shut off the sand supply at the end
of the cycle. This ensures that the classifier body does not pack
full, maintaining consistent fluidization pressures and rates.
Heating water is supplied to the heat
exchanger from a natural gas hot water boiler, unless otherwise
specified. The boiler coupled with standard high resolution
Honeywell temperature controller ensure constant exit temperatures
even on the coolest day. An atmospheric hot water natural gas
heating boiler is supplied as standard equipment.
Cooling water as standard would be
supplied from city or natural well water. However, the system is
easily adapted to include cooling tower or chiller controls.
Temperature in cooling mode is controlled by the same Honeywell
controller as is used for heating, simplifying controls and
operation.
Controls
The standard control system includes all
components necessary for the operation of this unit. All primary
operating components are Allen-Bradley, the control transformer is
ACME, and the temperature controller is Honeywell. These components
are all off-the-shelf and available from high quality industrial and
electrical supply houses.
A modulating valve, included as
standard, regulates the flow of either cooling or heating water to
the unit. This regulation is controlled automatically using a PID
control loop. The closer the sand is to the desired process
temperature, the less water will flow through the heat exchange
bundle. The heating system is closed loop as standard. The cooling
system, if using city water is either sent to drain or to cooling
tanks. With the optional cooling tower or chiller package, the
cooling loop is closed as well, minimizing water consumption year
round.
The unit comes standard with all control
logic necessary for the automatic switching from heating to cooling.
Hardware for this (electrically actuated
diverter valves) is optional. Generally, all system valving and
piping to the unit is customer supplied as all shops have different
preferences for brand, type, routings, etc.
A rotary style level indicator controls
the operation of the unit. Located in the discharge hopper, the HCCL
seeks to maintain a full state. A run time timer initiates when the
level indicator is clear. This insures that a certain surge capacity
is always available.

General
The Magnetic Drum Separator is often necessary
insurance in any ferrous foundry operation against the potential damage to
“downstream” equipment caused by tramp metal or other ferrous metallic
objects that might bypass any faulty or inadequate screening in the shakeout
area.
The unit is normally (in a chemically bonded
system) located at the discharge end of a lumpbreaker where the sand lumps
have been reduced to grain-size. As the sand spills over the edge of the
discharge chute of the lumpbreaker, it is fed into the inlet hopper of the
magnetic drum separator from where it is gravity fed to the drum which is
revolving around a sectional, stationary, permanent magnet.
The magnetic field attracts and holds ferrous
particles to the outer surface of the drum while the non-magnetic material
falls freely from the drum surface down a discharge chute for sand only. The
ferrous particles are carried beyond the magnets’ influence where they fall
off and down a separate chute dedicated to trap ferrotic material. The unit
provides not only excellent separation, but controlled feed.
The section of the hopper that surrounds the
drum is manufactured from non-magnetic stainless steel to prevent induced
magnetism. The inlet chute of the unit is designed to direct the flow of
incoming material across the face of the drum, providing increased
efficiency of separation. The design also prevents heavier pieces of metal
from hitting and damaging the drum surface.
NOTE: To avoid problems both in the
Cooler/Classifier and the molding area from undesirable contaminants that
might be found in either the new or reclaimed sand, we strongly recommend
the inclusion of a screen in the intake of the Cooler/Classifier. Over the
years we have found that these screens are invaluable in saving on
maintenance in the form of “clean-out” time.

System Overview
Mixing
Chamber - All Palmer mixing chambers feature ultra-heavy construction.
The regenerative sand lining protects the primary fabrication while
imparting the highest mixing efficiency possible. Heavy gage steel chambers
with turned, ground, and polished mixer shafts are standard. Direct drive
system - no gearboxes, belts, or chains.
Mixing Blades - All Palmer blades
feature tungsten carbide tipped mixing blades. These blades offer extremely
long life. Our 1/4" thick carbide is twice as thick as others.
Sand Metering - All Palmer mixers
utilize fixed orifice sand metering devices for the ultimate in process
consistency.
Pumping System - All Palmer mixers feature as standard
magnetically coupled pumps. Palmer's resin delivery system ensures
consistent resin flow and greatly reduced effects of resin viscosity changes
as compared to others. A PLC is used to control all critical mixer timing
functions to ensure usable first and last sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Air Jets
All Palmer mixers feature easily removable resin delivery jets.
Using the slip fit jet, the operator can easily calibrate at the
actual point of resin entry, not a remote ball valve as others do. A
low flow air assist keeps the resin ports open and aid in the up
front blending of resin onto the sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Control System
All Palmer mixers are fitted with a high quality electrical
control system featuring standard OEM components and complete
control integration. A PLC is used to control all critical mixer
timing functions to ensure usable first and last sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Mixing Chamber/Motor Head Assembly
The mixing chamber is a direct drive design that eliminates all
maintenance associated with timing belt and gear
drive
systems. The mixing chamber is made from heavy walled tubing that is externally
reinforced for maximum
rigidity
and stiffness.
The mixing chamber doors
feature heavy-duty quick release knobs that allow for simple, easy access to
the interior
of the chamber. The doors are hinged at the bottom and swing
down to allow complete access to the mixing blades
and driveshaft. The
hinged doors eliminate all ergonomic problems associated with the removal of
fabricated
components from the mixer.
The heavy-duty driveshaft is made from ground and polished-stress proofed
steel shafting and is direct coupled to
the main drive motor.
The mixing blades are faced with ¼” thick tungsten carbide and are a
fixed position blade with predetermined angles
and head heights. This
greatly simplifies the replacement process and eliminates the need for
constant blade inspection
and adjustment found with other blade designs.
The mixing blades are overlapping and sized to allow a build up of
resinous material that creates the lining of the inside
of the mixing
chamber. This lining provides an optimum relationship between the end of the
blade and the interior
diameter of the chamber. It is constantly maintained
by each blade wear as it occurs. With this lining as an intentional
part of
the mixing chamber, the daily cleaning consists of only removing the build
up on the mixing blades and driveshaft.
The mixing chamber is designed to be as rugged yet simple as possible.
The fixed position mixing blades, close
tolerance regenerative lining, and
high speed rotation provide and extremely intense blending action with a
minimum
amount of cleaning and maintenance.
RETURN TO TOP
Controls
All main electrical components are housed in a NEMA 12 dust tight
disconnect enclosure. All components are
thoughtfully
arranged for ease of
operation and maintenance.
A small enclosure is located at the operator station and contains the
control switches needed for automatic mixer operation.
The control system has a master safety relay with mixing door limit
switch and emergency stop pushbuttons on both the machine cabinet and the
operator station.
There are two modes of mixer operation:
“HAND” – This is a manual mode of operation which any or
all aspects of the mixer are operated via two virtual position switches,
located on the HMI in the door of the enclosure.
“AUTO” – In this mode of operation, all aspects of the mixer are run from
a remote panel located at the operator’s station.
A single three phase electrical service is required. An internal KVA
transformer housed in the enclosure provides the
120-volt control power.
Four speed
settings are included. Speed setting is quick and easy for each level.
All timer functions are controlled by a PLC: pump on
/ off delays, slidegate on / off delays,
calibration timer, etc.
Main enclosure – Hoffman NEMA 12 Disconnect
Main control components – High Quality
Control transformer – High Quality
Main voltage requirements – 60 Amp 240/480 3 Ph 60 Hz
Control voltage – 120 volt
RETURN TO TOP
Pumping System
The pumping system is housed in a separate enclosure to protect the
components from the plant environment.
The system will consist of:
Two magnetically coupled pumps
Two fast action stainless steel air
actuated 3-way valves
Optional piston type catalyst metering pump for 3 part PUNB systems
The pump motors provide consistent output RPM across the operating range.
The pumps are direct
coupled to the drive motors to eliminate the inaccuracy found in chain,
belt, and gear reduction
couplings. The direct in-line coupling also
eliminates all side load on pump bearings and packing extending the life of
the pump.
Fast response air actuated 3-way ball valves
provide instant routing of chemicals to the mixing chamber.
A low pressure air jet system provides a
low CFM air flow to help introduce the chemicals into the mixing chamber
and
keep the mixing chamber resin ports clear. The air jet system is fully
adjustable via flow controls located in the
electrical enclosure.
RETURN TO TOP
Standards
Recirculating Pumps
The resin pumps run continuously and the three way ball valves
divert to the mixing chamber when called on. This system is helpful in
maintaining resin temperature.
Calibration Timer with Remote Start / Stop
Buttons
The calibration timer is included with
the PLC System. The PLC controls the pump on / off delay timer, slide gate
on / off timer, purge timer, etc. This
system has proven itself to be very reliable and easy
to use.

Foundry Products:
Vibrating Screener
General
Sand
fed from the underside of the return sand storage hopper, passes through the
three-stage scrubber to the vibrating screen which is located inside the
cooler/classifier. Consisting of a woven wire steel mesh stretched over a
curved frame, the screen is vibrated by means of a pneumatically operated
piston-type vibrator. This unit is mounted on a framework inside the top of
the cooler/classifier, from which it is isolated by means of leaf springs.
This prevents the possibility of transferring any vibration from the screen
to the body of the cooler/classifier.
The purpose of the screen is to remove all
contaminants from the sand, such as pieces of metal, ceramic sleeves,
pouring cups, and larger than grain-size agglomerates. Any such contaminants
are discharged from the top surface of the screen to the outside of the
cooler/classifier via a waste chute, into a customer-provided waste bin.
All dust produced by the screening process is
removed by dust collector used with the cooler/classifier. This is the main
reason for mounting the screen inside this unit.

System Overview
Mixing
Chamber - All Palmer mixing chambers feature ultra-heavy construction.
The regenerative sand lining protects the primary fabrication while
imparting the highest mixing efficiency possible. Heavy gage steel chambers
with turned, ground, and polished mixer shafts are standard. Direct drive
system - no gearboxes, belts, or chains.
Mixing Blades - All Palmer blades
feature tungsten carbide tipped mixing blades. These blades offer extremely
long life. Our 1/4" thick carbide is twice as thick as others.
Sand Metering - All Palmer mixers
utilize fixed orifice sand metering devices for the ultimate in process
consistency.
Pumping System - All Palmer mixers feature as standard
magnetically coupled pumps. Palmer's resin delivery system ensures
consistent resin flow and greatly reduced effects of resin viscosity changes
as compared to others. A PLC is used to control all critical mixer timing
functions to ensure usable first and last sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Palmer M300XLD with dual hoppers.
Air Jets
All Palmer mixers feature easily removable resin delivery jets.
Using the slip fit jet, the operator can easily calibrate at the
actual point of resin entry, not a remote ball valve as others do. A
low flow air assist keeps the resin ports open and aid in the up
front blending of resin onto the sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Control System
All Palmer mixers are fitted with a high quality electrical
control system featuring standard OEM components and complete
control integration. A PLC is used to control all critical mixer
timing functions to ensure usable first and last sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Mixing Chamber/Motor Head Assembly
The mixing chamber is a direct drive design that eliminates all
maintenance associated with timing belt and gear drive systems. The mixing chamber is made from heavy walled tubing that is externally
reinforced for maximum rigidity and stiffness.
The mixing chamber doors
feature heavy-duty quick release knobs that allow for simple, easy access to
the interior of the chamber. The doors are hinged at the bottom and swing
down to allow complete access to the mixing blades and driveshaft. The
hinged doors eliminate all ergonomic problems associated with the removal of
fabricated components from the mixer.
The heavy-duty driveshaft is made from ground and polished-stress proofed
steel shafting and is direct coupled to the main drive motor.
The mixing blades are faced with ¼” thick tungsten carbide and are a
fixed position blade with predetermined angles and head heights. This
greatly simplifies the replacement process and eliminates the need for
constant blade inspection and adjustment found with other blade designs.
The mixing blades are overlapping and sized to allow a build up of
resinous material that creates the lining of the inside of
the mixing
chamber. This lining provides an optimum relationship between the end of the
blade and the interior diameter of
the chamber. It is constantly maintained
by each blade wear as it occurs. With this lining as an intentional part of
the mixing chamber, the daily cleaning consists of only removing the build
up on the mixing blades and driveshaft.
The mixing chamber is designed to be as rugged yet simple as possible.
The fixed position mixing blades, close tolerance regenerative lining, and
high speed rotation provide and extremely intense blending action with a
minimum amount of cleaning and maintenance.

Controls
All main electrical components are housed in a NEMA 12 dust tight
disconnect enclosure. All components are thoughtfully arranged for ease of
operation and maintenance.
A small enclosure is located at the operator station and contains the
control switches needed for automatic mixer operation.
The control system has a master safety relay with mixing door limit
switch and emergency stop pushbuttons on both the machine cabinet and the
operator station.
There are two modes of mixer operation:
“HAND” – This is a manual mode of operation which any or
all aspects of the mixer are operated via two virtual position switches,
located on the HMI in the door of the enclosure.
“AUTO” – In this mode of operation, all aspects of the mixer are run from
a remote panel located at the operator’s station.
A single three phase electrical service is required. An internal KVA
transformer housed in the enclosure provides the
120-volt control power.
Four speed
settings are included. Speed setting is quick and easy for each level.
All timer functions are controlled by a PLC: pump on
/ off delays, slidegate on / off delays,
calibration timer, etc.
Main enclosure – Hoffman NEMA 12 Disconnect
Main control components – High Quality
Control transformer – High Quality
Main voltage requirements – 60 Amp 240/480 3 Ph 60 Hz
Control voltage – 120 volt
RETURN TO TOP
Pumping System
The pumping system is housed in a separate enclosure to protect the
components from the plant environment.
The system will consist of:
Two magnetically coupled pumps
Two fast action stainless steel air
actuated 3-way valves
Optional piston type catalyst metering pump for 3 part PUNB systems
The pump motors provide consistent output RPM across the operating range.
The pumps are direct
coupled to the drive motors to eliminate the inaccuracy found in chain,
belt, and gear reduction
couplings. The direct in-line coupling also
eliminates all side load on pump bearings and packing extending the life of
the pump.
Fast response air actuated 3-way ball valves
provide instant routing of chemicals to the mixing chamber.
A low pressure air jet system provides a
low CFM air flow to help introduce the chemicals into the mixing chamber and
keep the mixing chamber resin ports clear. The air jet system is fully
adjustable via flow controls located in the
electrical enclosure.
RETURN TO TOP
Standards
Recirculating Pumps
The resin pumps run continuously and the three way ball valves
divert to the mixing chamber when called on. This system is helpful in
maintaining resin temperature.
Calibration Timer with Remote Start / Stop
Buttons
The calibration timer is included with
the PLC System. The PLC controls the pump on / off delay timer, slide gate
on / off timer, purge timer, etc. This
system has proven itself to be very reliable and easy
to use.

and trials on frac sand, rubber crumb, adhesives, wood fiber,
salt, baghouse fines, oxides, carbon, titanium, carbide, and
many others.
Our laboratory, The Strausbaugh Technology Center, is equipped
with the necessary equipment to perform standard foundry sand
tests: LOI, ADV, Screen Analysis, Tensile Testing, Transverse
Testing, pH Testing, Percent Sodium or Potassium Testing, as
well as other non-foundry tests.
We can meter mix aggregate powders, liquids, and
chemicals of all kinds. Our extensive knowledge of solids and liquid
metering in addition to our 35 years of mixing experience makes us an ideal
testing lab for many industrial and manufacturing applications.
Our
facility is equipped to handle extensive tests including: sand testing,
degassing, metal filtration, drying, mixing, core blowing and more. We will
complete testing as specified by you, and provide you with written
documentation of the testing results. In addition, we welcome the
opportunity to take a closer look at how your material will perform with
Palmer’s equipment. Test fees can be applied to the total price
when you purchase Palmer equipment within 6 months of the test results (up
to 5% of the total equipment cost). This takes the guesswork out of the
equation and reinforces our commitment to providing you with the absolute
best equipment for your process.
For

Pumping System Options
3rd Part Pump
This option provides a
DC voltage precision metering pump for three part phenolic urethane
applications.
Hastalloy Pump
This provides a wetted
packing sealed gear pump made of Hastalloy-C steel for acid catalyst
applications. This option includes a PVC air actuated ball valve.
Ryton Pump
This provides a wetted
packing sealed gear pump made of fiberglass reinforced Ryton
composite pump body and gears for acid catalyst applications. This
option includes a PVC air-actuated ball valve.
Stainless Steel Pump
This provides a wetted
packing sealed gear pump made of stainless steel for some acid
catalyst applications. This option includes a stainless steel air
actuated ball valve. This is a lower cost option than the
Hastalloy-C pump option but will not be as compatible with most
acids.
Isoset Pumping
System
This upgrade consists of
all required components for use with the Isoset or comparable resin
system. It includes a stainless steel pump one and ball valve as
well as a continuous cavity, non-shearing pump 2 and pneumatic pinch
valve set. Note that this system is set up for recirculation of
liquid components.
2nd Coreactant Pump
This option works well
for production floors that require two different mold set-up rates
with a binder system that requires different activators for
different set-up speeds. This option is commonly used with
ester-cured phenolics, sodium silicates, and other binder systems
where the amount of activator does not affect strip time as much as
the chemical composition.
2nd Acid Pump
This option works well
for production floors that require two different mold set-up rates
with a furan or other acid based binder system that require
different activators for different set-up speeds. This option can be
used with Ryton, Stainless Steel, or Hastalloy-C pumps.
Recirculating Pumps
The option replaces the
two-way air actuated ball valves provided with the standard pumping
system with three way valves. The resin pumps run continuously and
the three way ball valves divert to the mixing chamber when called
on. This system is helpful in maintaining resin temperature and when
utilizing flow meters for liquid usage measurement and control.
Magnetically Coupled Pumps
This option
replaces the standard system pumps with magnetically coupled,
micro gear pumps. The pumps are DC driven,
identical to the standard pump, but they operate in a
recirculating manner. The magnetic coupling
provides seal-less operation, which eliminates any maintenance
associated with pump shaft seal replacement. Also
included with this option are recirculating diverter valves for
each pump.
Trial Pumping System
This option is ideal for
foundries that regularly perform trials or switch binder systems.
The standard pumping system pictured is easily interchangeable and
upgradeable. For a full description of the controls and
capabilities, refer to the Retrofit Pumping System section of this
web-site.

System Overview
Mixing Chamber - All Palmer mixing chambers feature
ultra-heavy construction. The regenerative sand lining
protects the primary fabrication while imparting the highest
mixing efficiency possible. Heavy gage steel chambers with
turned, ground, and polished mixer shafts are standard.
Direct drive system - no gearboxes, belts, or chains.
Mixing Blades - All Palmer blades feature tungsten carbide
tipped mixing blades. These blades offer extremely long
life. Our 1/4" thick carbide is twice as thick as others.
Sand Metering - All Palmer mixers utilize fixed orifice sand
metering devices for the ultimate in process consistency.
Pumping System - All Palmer mixers feature as
standard magnetically coupled pumps. Palmer's resin delivery
system ensures consistent resin flow and greatly reduced
effects of resin viscosity changes as compared to others. A
PLC is used to control all critical mixer timing functions
to ensure usable first and last sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Air Jets
All Palmer mixers feature easily removable resin delivery jets.
Using the slip fit jet, the operator can easily calibrate at the
actual point of resin entry, not a remote ball valve as others
do. A low flow air assist keeps the resin ports open and aid in
the up front blending of resin onto the sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Control System
All Palmer mixers are fitted with a high quality electrical
control system featuring standard OEM components and complete
control integration. A PLC is used to control all critical mixer
timing functions to ensure usable first and last sand.

Mixing Chamber/Motor Head
Assembly
The mixing chamber is a direct drive design
that eliminates all maintenance associated with timing belt and gear drive
systems. The mixing chamber is made from heavy walled tubing that is
externally reinforced for maximum rigidity and
stiffness.
The mixing chamber doors feature heavy-duty
quick release knobs that allow for simple, easy access to the interior of
the chamber. The doors are hinged at the bottom and swing down to allow
complete access to the mixing blades and
driveshaft. The hinged doors
eliminate all ergonomic problems associated with the removal of fabricated
components
from the mixer.
The heavy-duty driveshaft is made from ground
and polished-stress proofed steel shafting and is direct coupled to the
main
drive motor.
The mixing blades are faced with ¼” thick
tungsten carbide and are a fixed position blade with predetermined angles
and
head heights. This greatly simplifies the replacement process and
eliminates the need for constant blade inspection and
adjustment found with
other blade designs.
The mixing blades are overlapping and sized
to allow a build up of resinous material that creates the lining of the
inside of
the mixing chamber. This lining provides an optimum relationship
between the end of the blade and the interior diameter of
the chamber. It is
constantly maintained by each blade wear as it occurs. With this lining as
an intentional part of the
mixing chamber, the daily cleaning consists of
only removing the build up on the mixing blades and driveshaft.
The mixing chamber is designed to be as
rugged yet simple as possible. The fixed position mixing blades, close
tolerance regenerative lining, and high speed rotation provide and extremely
intense blending action with a minimum amount
of cleaning and maintenance.

Controls
All main electrical components are housed in
a NEMA 12 dust tight disconnect enclosure. All components are thoughtfully
arranged for ease of operation and maintenance.
A small enclosure is located at the operator
station and contains the control switches needed for automatic mixer
operation.
The control system has a master safety relay
with mixing door limit switch and emergency stop pushbuttons on both the
machine cabinet and the operator station.
There are two modes of mixer operation:
“HAND” – This is a manual mode of operation which any or all
aspects of the mixer are operated via two virtual position switches,
located on the HMI in the door of the enclosure.
“AUTO” – In this mode of
operation, all aspects of the mixer are run from a remote panel located
at the operator’s station.
A single three phase electrical service is
required. An internal KVA transformer housed in the enclosure provides the
120-volt control power.
Four speed settings are included. Speed setting is quick and easy
for each level.
All timer functions are controlled by a PLC: pump on / off delays, slidegate on / off delays,
calibration timer, etc.
Main enclosure – Hoffman NEMA 12

Main control components – High Quality
Control transformer – High Quality

Control voltage – 120 volt
RETURN TO TOP
Pumping System
The pumping system is housed in a separate
enclosure to protect the components from the plant environment.
The
system will consist of:
Two magnetically coupled pumps
Two fast action stainless steel air
actuated 3-way valves
Optional piston type catalyst metering pump for 3 part PUNB systems
The pump motors provide consistent output RPM across the operating
range.
The pumps are direct coupled to the drive
motors to eliminate the inaccuracy found in chain, belt, and gear reduction
couplings. The direct in-line coupling also eliminates all side load on pump
bearings and packing extending the life
of the pump.
Fast response air actuated 3-way ball valves
provide instant routing of chemicals to the mixing chamber.
A low pressure air jet system provides a low
CFM air flow to help introduce the chemicals into the mixing chamber and
keep the mixing chamber resin ports clear. The air jet system is fully
adjustable via flow controls located in the electrical enclosure.

Standards
Recirculating Pumps
The resin pumps run continuously and the three way ball valves
divert to the mixing chamber when called on. This system is helpful in
maintaining resin temperature.
Calibration Timer with Remote Start / Stop
Buttons
The calibration timer is included with
the PLC System. The PLC controls the pump on / off delay timer, slide gate
on / off timer, purge timer, etc. This
system has proven itself to be very reliable and easy
to use.

Basic Description
The COREMAKER GS Series of amine gas
generators is designed with simplicity and repeatability in mind.
Palmer gas generation systems are provided complete with stainless
steel amine pump, process air heater, all necessary process timers
and interconnecting controls for existing core machines.
Operation
GS-10 - The GS-10 is a compact gassing
system for cores up to 30 pounds. It features a sealed enclosure for
the storage of amine liquid in 5 gallon pails (other sizes
available). The amine supply pump extracts liquid amine from the
supply and pumps it directly to the system venturi. Amine is metered
into the venturi through a fast acting stainless steel ball valve.
Amine gassing and purge time are easily adjusted within the system
process controller. Once the amine is injected, the heated process
purge air is introduced to carry the amine gas to the core machine.
The purge air is heated within a high quality process heater for
improved amine usage efficiency. Process heater air temperature is
digitally controlled.
While simple, the operation of the GS-10
is extremely repeatable. Additionally, its simplicity makes for
easier understanding and troubleshooting by operators and improved
up time.

Foundry Products:
Palmer Suspended Magnets
Suspended Magnets are constructed with an
oversized Plate Magnet. They are designed for suspension above a belt
conveyor. As product passes under the magnet, metal contaminants are drawn
out of the material to the face of the magnet. This style of magnet should
be installed at the discharge of the head pulley if possible. Material will
be flowing more freely and can be thrown into the face of the magnet
increasing the separation results over an installation that has the magnet
suspended over a troughed belt. This can be supplied with a wiper arm or
stripper plate to simplify cleaning. For automated continuous cleaning, a
POW-R CLEAN option can be selected which incorporates a set of pulleys,
belt, motor, and reducer that travels around the Suspended Belt Magnet
discharging metal contaminants automatically.
Manual Clean Suspended Magnet
Manual
Clean Suspended Magnet This unit simply suspends above the conveyor belt or
the head pulley and lifts tramp metal from the product burden as it passes
through the powerful magnetic field. Four eyebolts are provided for
suspension (suspension chain not included). Cleaning is achieved by manually
removing the collected tramp metal from the face of the magnet. E-Z CLEAN
options are available to simplify cleaning. Available in permanent and
electromagnetic designs.
POW-R CLEAN Suspended Belt Magnet
POW-R
CLEAN Suspended Belt Magnet This unit when suspended above the conveyor belt
or head pulley automatically discharges the tramp metal that has been
removed from the product burden. Similar to the manual clean unit, this
design incorporates a set of pulleys along with a motor and reducer to drive
a cleated belt around the magnet assembly.Available in permanent and
electromagnetic designs.

System Overview
Mixing Chamber - All Palmer mixing chambers feature ultra-heavy
construction. The regenerative sand lining protects the primary
fabrication while imparting the highest mixing efficiency
possible. Heavy gage steel chambers with turned, ground, and
polished mixer shafts are standard. Direct drive system - no
gearboxes, belts, or chains.
Mixing Blades - All Palmer blades feature tungsten carbide
tipped mixing blades. These blades offer extremely long life.
Our 1/4" thick carbide is twice as thick as others.
Sand Metering - All Palmer mixers utilize fixed orifice sand
metering devices for the ultimate in process consistency.
Pumping System - All Palmer mixers feature as standard
magnetically coupled pumps. Palmer's resin delivery system
ensures consistent resin flow and greatly reduced effects of
resin viscosity changes as compared to others. A PLC is used to
control all critical mixer timing functions to ensure usable
first and last sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Air Jets
All Palmer mixers feature easily removable resin delivery jets.
Using the slip fit jet, the operator can easily calibrate at the
actual point of resin entry, not a remote ball valve as others do. A
low flow air assist keeps the resin ports open and aid in the up
front blending of resin onto the sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Control System
All Palmer mixers are fitted with a high quality electrical
control system featuring standard OEM components and complete
control integration. A PLC is used to control all critical mixer
timing functions to ensure usable first and last sand.
RETURN TO TOP
Mixing Chamber/Motor Head Assembly
The mixing chamber is a direct drive design that eliminates all
maintenance associated with timing belt and gear drive systems. The mixing chamber is made from heavy walled tubing that is externally
reinforced for maximum rigidity and stiffness.
The mixing chamber doors
feature heavy-duty quick release knobs that allow for simple, easy access to
the interior of the chamber. The doors are hinged at the bottom and swing
down to allow complete access to the mixing blades and driveshaft. The
hinged doors eliminate all ergonomic problems associated with the removal of
fabricated components from the mixer.
The heavy-duty driveshaft is made from ground and polished-stress proofed
steel shafting and is direct coupled to the main drive motor.
The mixing blades are faced with ¼” thick tungsten carbide and are a
fixed position blade with predetermined angles and head heights. This
greatly simplifies the replacement process and eliminates the need for
constant blade inspection and adjustment found with other blade designs.
The mixing blades are overlapping and sized to allow a build up of
resinous material that creates the lining of the inside of the mixing
chamber. This lining provides an optimum relationship between the end of the
blade and the interior diameter of the chamber. It is constantly maintained
by each blade wear as it occurs. With this lining as an intentional part of
the mixing chamber, the daily cleaning consists of only removing the build
up on the mixing blades and driveshaft.
The mixing chamber is designed to be as rugged yet simple as possible.
The fixed position mixing blades, close tolerance regenerative lining, and
high speed rotation provide and extremely intense blending action with a
minimum amount of cleaning and maintenance.
RETURN TO TOP
Controls
All main electrical components are housed in a NEMA 12 dust tight
disconnect enclosure. All components are thoughtfully arranged for ease of
operation and maintenance.
A small enclosure is located at the operator station and contains the
control switches needed for automatic mixer operation.
The control system has a master safety relay with mixing door limit
switch and emergency stop pushbuttons on both the machine cabinet and the
operator station.
There are two modes of mixer operation:
“HAND” – This is a manual mode of operation which any or
all aspects of the mixer are operated via two virtual position switches,
located on the HMI in the door of the enclosure.
“AUTO” – In this mode of operation, all aspects of the mixer are run from
a remote panel located at the operator’s station.
A single three phase electrical service is required. An external KVA
transformer housed in the enclosure provides the 120-volt control power.
Four speed
settings are included. Speed setting is quick and easy for each level.
All timer functions are controlled by a PLC: pump on
/ off delays, slidegate on / off delays, calibration timer, etc.
Main enclosure – Hoffman NEMA 12 Disconnect
Main control components – High Quality
Control transformer – High Quality
Main voltage requirements – 60 Amp 240/480 3 Ph 60 Hz
Control voltage – 120 volt
RETURN TO TOP
Pumping System
The pumping system is housed in a separate enclosure to protect the
components from the plant environment. The system will consist of:
Two magnetically coupled pumps
Two fast action stainless steel air
actuated 3-way valves
Optional piston type catalyst metering pump for 3 part PUNB systems
The pump motors provide consistent output RPM across the operating range.
The pumps are direct
coupled to the drive motors to eliminate the inaccuracy found in chain,
belt, and gear reduction couplings. The direct in-line coupling also
eliminates all side load on pump bearings and packing extending the life of
the pump.
Fast response air actuated 3-way ball valves
provide instant routing of chemicals to the mixing chamber.
A low pressure air jet system provides a
low CFM air flow to help introduce the chemicals into the mixing chamber and
keep the mixing chamber resin ports clear. The air jet system is fully
adjustable via flow controls located in the electrical enclosure.
RETURN TO TOP
Standards
Recirculating Pumps
The resin pumps run continuously and the three way ball valves
divert to the mixing chamber when called on. This system is helpful in
maintaining resin temperature.
Calibration Timer with Remote Start / Stop
Buttons
The calibration timer is included with
the PLC System. The PLC controls the pump on / off delay timer, slide gate
on / off timer, purge timer, etc. This
system has proven itself to be very reliable and easy
to use.

Whiting-Turner Contracting recently wrote this statement about how pleased they were with our installation of a molding system.
In 2020, Palmer completed a molding system installation for Whiting-Turner Contracting.
"It has certainly been a pleasure doing business with everyone at Palmer. Your engineering team was very responsive throughout the entire process. Brandon Myers was excellent at responding to all questions, concerns, and managing the installation and training. We also appreciated being able to come to the Palmer production facility to inspect the equipment. Additionally, we felt your technical sales staff did a great job in explaining the system prior to purchase.
Our system arrived in excellent condition and your team did a great job completing the installation despite the difficult environment. Most importantly, Palmer responded to punch list items in a timely manner. I wish to also highlight the professional and informative training provided by both Brandon Myers and Ken Strausbaugh with the owner and operators.

The 5 C's of No-Bake Molding
Properly managing coating, "cooking," coring, closing, and clamping will result in a safe and productive production line.
By Jack Palmer
Whether you are a high-production automated foundry or making individual castings on the molding floor, the same five processes apply to the construction of a sound chemically bonded sand mold. We refer to these as the 5 C's. Each process builds on the previous one and each one needs to be considered carefully.

Acetarc Safe-Pour (zero harm) bottom pouring system
The Acetarc Safe-pour (zero harm) bottom pouring system allows the operator full freedom of movement enabling the operator be located in a safe position when using bottom pour ladles.
The bottom pour mechanism is similar to a conventional manually operated unit, with a guided slide bar raising the stopper rod assembly to commence pouring. However the Safe-pour system, instead of a manually operated lever, uses a cylinder to raise the slide bar. The unit has radio remote control and is battery powered so the ladle does not require connection to a power cable.  The system is designed to be fail safe so that the slide bar will automatically lower, stopping the pour, if either the radio signal or power is interrupted.

Custom Coremakers From Palmer
Running a jobbing foundry is tough no matter how you look at it. Environmental compliance, personnel issues, government regulations, equipment problems, tooling issues, etc., can make for some pretty long days. The type, size, or complexity of work varies from day to day, week to week, or month to month. Jobbing shops are substantially different than production shops in that hundreds or even thousands of parts of any size or type require a completely different approach.

Preventing Defects With Venting
Article Takeaways:
Reduce defects with venting
Fixed & variable venting solutions
A wise foundry veteran said “...vent, vent, and vent some more.” Venting is one of the most critical aspects of any molding/ pouring system to eliminate gas related defects, such as blowholes, improve the surface finish, and allow for shorter pouring times.
Oddly, everyone recognizes the need to vent cores and molds to avoid problems from entrapped gases. Too often, though venting (which is not very difficult) is overlooked until a problem develops.

Palmer Announces Video for New Rollover with Patented Safety Braking System
Palmer Manufacturing & Supply, Inc., was recently issued U.S. Patent No. 9,937,552 for its Safety Braking System for Rollover Draw Machines.
Rollovers move and manipulate heavy molds. Our spring-loaded braking system is positioned away from the drum and held open by hydraulic pressure. Therefore, if power is lost, the control system automatically releases the spring which completely stops the system immediately. Additionally, there are encoders located on the mechanical drive and drum that monitor speed. If the speed varies by more than 1% the system also automatically activates the externally compressing bands.

How to Upgrade Equipment & Systems Controls
As a supplier of foundry equipment, we are constantly approached by customers to provide a means of increasing capacity and capability for their molding and reclamation systems. In order to be most cost-effective, it is often desired to use existing pieces of equipment that the customer may already have in their facility. With many pieces of foundry equipment and the abuse that they are required to endure, we often find that the mechanical aspects of the machine were designed so heavy duty that they are still in good working order, but that the controls have long since fallen from the technological cutting edge. With proper planning and research, it is possible to take an existing piece of equipment and upgrade the controls to allow it to meet the newly established production requirements.
A couple examples are:

Palmer Flip Molding Machine
In any jobbing foundry, all products are variable. Tooling is often new, old, cope/drag, matchplate, green sand, no-bake, shell, metal, wood, plastic, or any combination thereof. Quantities can range from 1 or 2 pieces up to hundreds or thousands. The Palmer FMM was designed to be a high production No-Bake molding system with low capital costs that could make No-bake molds with any of this tooling with minimal set-up, minimal tooling modifications, and unskilled laborers.  The Flip Molding Machines uses copy/drag tooling and cast iron tooling plates to accept cope/drag no-bake boxes.
FMM Production Rates - production rates of 30 molds per hours with a 4-station FMM are easily achieved with 1-2 operators, depending on level of mold prep needed.
No Rollover Needed - the FMM achieves a high mold production rate without a rollover. Because the pattern is inverted automatically and drawn onto a precision scissors lift, a rollover isn’t necessary and any amount of daylight is available at no additional expense.
FMM 4-station capacities:
Mold Sizes: 12x12 4/4 to 60x60 36/36
Mold Depth: up to 36”
Stations: 4

Palmer Manufacturing & Supply, Announces Safety Braking System Patent
Palmer Manufacturing & Supply, Inc., was recently issued U.S. Patent No. 9,937,552 for its Safety Braking System for Rollover Draw Machines.
This patented braking system is unique to Rollover Draw Machines, as it is employed in conjunction with the regular service brake, although they operate separately. This dual system doubles the reliability and safety of the overall braking system.
Rollovers move and manipulate heavy molds. Our spring-loaded braking system is positioned away from the drum and held open by hydraulic pressure. Therefore, if power is lost, the control system automatically releases the spring which completely stops the system immediately.  Additionally, there are encoders located on the mechanical drive and drum that monitor speed. If the speed varies by more than 1% the system also automatically activates the externally compressing bands.
“The Rollover Draw Machine is the heaviest piece of equipment in a no-bake system. We set out to design a safety braking system that would protect operators in the event of a drive or component failure. We are proud to have engineered an industry-first in this regard and to have been awarded this patent,” said Jack Palmer, President.

New Universal Molding Machine Uses Existing Tooling For Faster & Flexible Production
Palmer Manufacturing & Supply, Inc., introduced at CastExpo 2016 a Universal Molding Machine (UMM) – a revolutionary molding concept that uses either existing green sand or No-Bake tooling.
The UMM was developed in response to the typical jobbing foundry environment where production is variable and quantities can range from a few pieces to thousands.  And, tooling is often a combination of new, old, cope/drag, matchplate, green sand, No-Bake, shell, metal, wood, or plastic.
The Palmer UMM was designed to be a high production molding system that could make No-Bake molds using any tooling with minimal set-up, minimal tooling modifications, and unskilled laborers.
“The ability to accept either green sand or No-Bake tooling is an innovation that allows any modern jobbing metalcasting foundry to be flexible with their production and more efficient,” said Jack Palmer, president of Palmer Manufacturing & Supply.
How it Works
The UMM tooling frames were designed to accept cope / drag No-Bake boxes where they are mounted back to back and run matchplate style, as well as any type or size of green sand tooling.
Green sand matchplates only need a simple 2x wooden box mounted to both sides and then fastened to the tooling frame, and No-Bake cope and drag boxes are simply mounted to the tooling frame  as is.
High Production Rates – NO ROLLOVER NEEDED!
Production rates up to 20 molds per hour with the 2-station UMM are easily achieved with one operator. Up to 65 molds per hour with the 6-station UMM are achieved with 2–3 operators – all without a rollover. Because the pattern is inverted automatically and drawn onto a precision scissors lift, a rollover isn't necessary and any amount of daylight is available at no additional expense.
Capacities
UMM 1, 2, 4, and 6-stations with capacities from 12x12 4/4 to 60x60 36/36 are available.
