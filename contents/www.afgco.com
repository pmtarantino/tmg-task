Additional Capabilities
To complement our die cutting, slitting, and laminating capabilities and deliver custom gaskets that perfectly match our customers’ requirements, Accurate Felt & Gasket (AFG) utilizes an array of secondary capabilities. While not all of them are directly related to the gasket manufacturing process, these services help us give our customers exactly what they’re after while reducing or eliminating the need for additional processing.
We Do More of the Work So You Don’t Have To
Our customer-oriented secondary services encompass everything from the manufacture of your custom gaskets to their final delivery at your location. AFG’s additional capabilities include:
Kiss cutting
Waterjet cutting
Knife cutting
Petroleum/oil soaking
Permanent-bonded protective Mylar coating
Material certification
Joint/flange analysis
PPAPs
IMDS
Reverse engineering
JIT manufacturing
Bag & seal/heat seal
Packaging in customer-supplied boxes/bags
Custom packaging
Bar coding
Labeling
Kanban programs
Blanket orders

Global shipping
SDS
Material Customization & Distribution
If you require custom gaskets in thicknesses that fall between “standard” measurements or are not readily available, AFG can skive felt and other materials to non-standard thicknesses. We can also combine multiple layers of materials for added thickness, as needed. In some instances, skiving a thicker material or layering a thinner one can both achieve the same effect—we will determine which is the best and most economical process for manufacturing your custom gaskets.
AFG is a master distributor of gasketing materials, providing distribution of smaller requirements of felt, cork, cork/rubber, and rubber materials. Since we stock a large and varied inventory of these materials, we can fill your requirements. Where there is a buy-direct dollar level to achieve, we can overcome it with our willingness to inventory materials to supply you with smaller quantities. Our primary sources of materials are Interface Performance Material (formerly Armstrong), Amorim, and Rubberlite.

Miscellaneous Materials & Specialty Gaskets
Accurate Felt & Gasket (AFG) works with a number of miscellaneous materials that are not always easily defined by broad categories. As requirements arise, we work to find the right specialty gasket material for your unique application. We also have customers who ask us to convert unique materials such as chamois material, roofing felt, onion skin paper, linoleum, and more to create specialty gaskets.
If you have a unique material requirement and don’t see it listed here, contact Accurate Felt & Gasket for options!  We will work with you to find a solution for your specialty material needs.
Specialty Gaskets & Miscellaneous Gasket Materials
In partnership with our suppliers, Accurate Felt & gasket distributes a full line of standard gaskets and materials used by domestic and international OEMs.  Our team also has the expertise to work with a broad range of exotic and specialty gasket materials including:
Metal Clad Gaskets: Constructed from metal and a gasket material such as graphite, cork, rubber, and fiber. There are two types of metal clad gaskets: A metal exterior with a gasket interior, and a metal interior and gasket material exterior. Metal clad gaskets have superior resistance to extreme temperatures and pressures and can withstand chemicals.
Grafoil™/Graphite/Graphite w/Metal Core: Anti-stick, flexible materials that resist heat, corrosion and chemicals. Grafoil has high chemical compatibility and is inert to most chemicals and gases. Graphite withstands extreme operating conditions involving high pressure and heat, and aggressive chemicals.   These exotic gasket materials are widely used for high temperature and exhaust applications including chemical plants, paper mills, and other industrial facilities.
Leather Material: Includes natural and synthetic leather used to make washers and other custom items. Natural leather is a deformable material that is tanned, treated and oiled to maintain suppleness and extend its lifespan. Synthetic leather is constructed of polyurethane foam pads with a leather-like outer layer that can be manufactured in different colors.
Styrofoam™ Specialty Gaskets: A durable material made of closed-cell polystyrene foam. It is water resistant and provides thermal insulation.
Insulfrax™ and Millboard High-Temperature Materials: Insulfrax™ is a ceramic fiber material that is lightweight, flexible, and has low thermal conductivity. It tolerates extremely high temperatures and is used in applications where the risk of combustion must be minimized. Millboard is made from clay, ceramic fiber, inert fillers, and binders and withstands extreme environments and exposure to molten metals.
Shim Stock Gaskets: This specialty gasket material is made from colored plastic, brass or aluminum and is as thin as a piece of paper. Shim stock material is used as a spacer in a bearing housing, for example.
Heat Shield Insulation Materials: Used in multi-layer heat shields, we offer next generation thermal materials for protection up to 1000°C in engine applications with virtually no detectable smoke or odor.
Rubber Coated Metal Gaskets: Specialty gaskets made from a “next generation” material that combines the durability of metal with the sealing capabilities of rubber. They are constructed of an aluminum or steel core that has a rubber coating on both sides to provide durability and elasticity. Rubber coated metal gaskets are used frequently in low pressure and high-pressure automotive applications.
Aluminum Specialty Gaskets: Aluminum is a durable and ductile material that can easily be formed into intricate gasket shapes. It is corrosion resistant and withstands high pressure. Applications include automotive, electronic and industrial.
Glass Wool & Mineral Wool: Non-combustible and insulative gasket materials made from rock, glass, slag, and minerals. The raw materials are melted down and spun into filaments, which are then formed into wool material using heat-activated binders. They are used in high-temperature applications and to contain fuel and gas.
Mesh Fabric (Monofilament Cloth): Has acoustical properties andprovides elasticity, high abrasion resistance, and good heat resistance. Mesh and technical fabrics are widely used for wet and dry filtration applications. Often these fabrics have pore sizes measured in micrometers (thousandths of an inch). We cut parts from open and closed mesh fabric for automotive, industrial and chemical applications, among others.
Vulcanized Rubber Gaskets: Synthetic rubber that is vulcanized to create a strong, flexible and highly heat resistant material. It is used to manufacture special gasket shapes and O-rings for a variety of custom applications.
Mylar® Gasket Material: A transparent, polyester-based film material that provides great dimensional stability and resists chemicals, moisture and abrasion. It has high tensile strength and is UL rated as an electrical insulation material. Mylar® is a specialty gasket material that provides a long-lasting seal that will not leak.
Select-a-Seal® Gasket Material: A rubber-edged composite that is lightweight, strong, temperature resistant, and provides a durable seal with superior adhesion.  Specialty gaskets made with this process are like a built-in O-ring on a cut gasket. They are ideal for irregular surfaces and flange surfaces.

Amorim Gasket Materials
Dating back to 1870 and located in Portugal, Amorim has become the global leader in and largest producer of cork and cork/rubber materials. Its signature is everywhere, from sports items to railroad and spacecraft components to wine stoppers and designer floor and wall coverings. Industrial applications include auto and motorcycle, radiators, bolted headers, pan gaskets, valve/cam covers, gear box covers, and specific UL applications.
Top Quality Cork & Cork Rubber Materials
Cork is the outer bark of the cork oak tree, which grows mainly in the Mediterranean region. The bark is an agglomeration of millions of cells filled with air. Cork is 100% natural, recyclable, and reusable—essential qualities in our environmentally friendly society.
The average cork oak tree has a life span of 250-350 years. It takes 25 years before it can be harvested the first time, then cork can be harvested every nine years. The primary use of cork is stoppers for wine and champagne bottles. The remaining material is ground up and mixed with other materials, like rubber, for specific applications.
Cork rubber material has several unique benefits for your customers.
Little to no side flow, improving crush-out resistance
Tolerant to extreme surface finishing conditions
Conformable to flanges with “out of flatness”
Low bolt torque
Good chemical resistance
Easy to fabricate
Available in blocks, sheets, rolls, and coils (with and without adhesive)
Cork rubber is the preferred material used across multiple applications and industries, ranging from marine and natural gas to industrial, heavy duty, military, and automotive. It provides high performance sealing and can is designed to resist oils, fuels, and gases. Thanks to cork rubbers’ conformability to “as cast” flanges, which are often out of flatness with rough and/or non-parallel surfaces, sealing can be achieved where fiber materials fall short. Whether you’re dealing with moisture, oils, fuels, gasses, dirt, or dust, robust and reliable sealing can be obtained with high performance cork and rubber materials.
In addition, cork and cork rubber provide vibration control, both internal and external, along with sound dampening and thermal protection. Uses are endless, all at a competitive cost. Click here to see material options.
Accurate Felt & Gasket can laminate adhesive, cut in to coils, and die cut gaskets from cork and cork and rubber material. Request a quote today or contact us to get started on your gasket project.
