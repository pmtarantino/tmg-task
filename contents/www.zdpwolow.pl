Disc Springs
Home > Products
A disc spring (sometimes called a “Belleville washer” after the inventor) consists primarily of a convex disc supported at the outer periphery by one force and an opposing force on the center of the disc. Disc springs are used singly, or in stacks, to achieve a desired load and travel. The advantage of a disc spring is that it generates a high force in a very short spring length and with minimal movement when compressed. All Kathysia disc springs are subject to exacting manufacturing and quality control standards. All discs are preset so that they will not significantly relax under load over time.Stacking Belleville Washers & Disc SpringsBelleville washers and other disc spring styles can be used singly or in stacks to achieve a desired load and travel. In general, they function best under conditions requiring a very high load in confined space or short travel. Under these constraints, it is often not practical or even possible to use a coil spring. In disc spring stacks, particularly those with parallel units, friction should be considered. Sliding friction is created at the disc’s adjoining, moving surfaces. As a result, the deflection which occurs when loading a stack of discs will lag as the stack is unloaded (hysteresis). This characteristic may be taken advantage of in shock or oscillatory loaded systems needing damping.Parallel StackIf you stack 6 discs in parallel, you gain 6 times the load capacity of a single disc, but your maximum deflection is that of a single disc. For example, one disc spring provides 16kgf @0.5mm deflection, using 6 discs, you would achieve a total load of 96kgf, an O.H. of 9mm, and a total deflection of 0.15mm.Series StackIf you stack 5 discs in a series, you achieve 5 times the deflection of one disc, but the same load as a single disc. For example, one disc spring provides 16kgf @0.5mm deflection, using 5 discs, you would achieve a total load of 16kgf, an O.H. of 20mm, and a total deflection of 2.5mm.Mixed Stacking – Parallel & SeriesBelleville washers stacked in series and parallel in combinations can be arranged to produce almost any load-vs.-deflection trend that you need (linear, progressive, regressive, etc.)

Torsion Springs
Home > Products
Torsion springs can store and release angular energy or statically hold a mechanism in place by deflecting the legs about the body centerline axis. They offer resistance to twist or rotationally applied force. A spring of this type will reduce in body diameter and increase slightly in body length when deflected in the preferred direction of the fabricated wind.  The springs usually connect to other components at both ends and require some type of force like pressing or twisting to function. Many springs of this type return to the original position once the force is stopped. This type of spring can be used for all sorts of applications involving new or aging equipment. Everyday uses include clothespins, ratchets, counterbalance mechanisms, and as a coupling between concentric shafts such as in motor and pump assembly.Torsion Springs CharacteristicsKathysia Industrial offers a selection of torsion springs with legs of equal length oriented at varying unloaded angles. The torsion spring configuration is created for the purpose of storing and releasing angular energy or for the purpose of statically holding a mechanism in place by deflecting the legs about the body centerline axis. A spring of this type will reduce in body diameter and increase slightly in body length when deflected in the preferred direction of the fabricated wind.The direction of the fabricated wind can also be important for torsion spring applications due to the leg bearing/attachment location having to be on the left or right side upon assembly.A torsion spring is normally supported by a rod (mandrel) that is coincident with the theoretical hingeline of the final product.Torsion Spring DimensionsHold the spring in one hand, and the calipers in the other hand.Place the caliper “teeth” on the inside diameter. This is called the Inside Diameter (I.D.).Place the calipers on the “leg” to measure the wire. This is called Material Size (or Wire Diameter).Place the calipers on the working coils of the spring. This is called the Body Length.Place the calipers on the working coils of the spring. This is called the Body Length.Count the total coils, beginning at one end, just under where the leg leaves the body. Count to the other end, all full coils, and any fraction thereof. This is called Number of Coils and determines leg position. i.e. 90°, 180°, etc.Determine the direction of coil (Wind Direction). See diagram for hand/finger illustration. Right Hand Wind or Left Hand Wind.MaterialsThe highest grades of spring wire are used when fabricating our torsion springs. To create cost-effective warehousing of our stock spring inventory for our customers, we offer material certification for custom springs only. Certifications of conformance for geometric tolerances set by the Spring Manufacturers Institute (SMI) are available for stock torsion springs upon request.The term “spring steel” is a stock inventory term covering music wire, hard-drawn(MB) wire, and oil-tempered wire. Additionally, our torsion spring materials include 300/400/600 series stainless steel.TolerancesTolerance values for torsion springs depend on the body-diameter to wire-diameter ratio and are about +/- 10% in torque and +/- 5% in diameter.FinishOur stock torsion springs come in a selection of commonly requested finishes:ZincPassivated (upon request)None (can be plated upon request)

Wire Forms Springs
Home > Products
Much like springs, wire forms are generally fashioned from round wire or strip material, then bent into shapes engineered to meet a specific task.  Rather than employing a coiled body, wire forms rely on angles and lengths to provide resistance and support.  Hooks and bends often act as attachment points for the device.Wire forms have many functions, but amongst the most common uses that we produce are for headsets, and computer brace components, but also we manufacture them as pins. For small quantity orders, we manually produce our wire forms, but for larger orders, wire forms are made automatically in highly advanced machinery, and we are proud to say that there are virtually no limits on design specifications of wire pins.By using the latest CNC automated spring coilers and wire forming equipment, Kathysia Industrial can easily manufacture a wide range of wire forms. In addition to this and another state of the art technology, we can also use manual processes to provide specialist hand cooling.Wire forms have a wide range of available designs, with the only limitations being in the imagination of the designer and the skill of the machine setter. Through continued investment in the latest CNC coiling and wire forming machines, we are able to produce a range of wire form shapes. From complex wire forms to simple designs, all of the products we offer can be made in any size of the order.Our experience of wire processing, including the knowledge of different grades of spring wire behaviors, allows us to achieve optimum utilization with our precision machinery. This ensures that your requirements will be met with the utmost precision and high standard of production, from start to finish.

Extension Springs
Home > Products
Extension springs are designed to absorb and store energy as well as create a resistance to a pulling force. It is initial tension that determines how tightly together an extension spring is coiled. This initial tension can be manipulated to achieve the load requirements of your particular application. All extension springs are wound with an initial tension force that offers a small deflection load for secure installation “holding”. The initial tension is equal to the minimum force required to separate adjacent coils. Each spring is of the constant diameter type with a variety of hook/loop styles. Spring Anchors are also available.CharacteristicsExtension springs are a type of tension spring. Helical extension springs store energy and exert a pulling force. Extension springs differ from compression springs in that they do not have a solid stop to prevent overloading.  For this reason, they are designed with lower stress levels. Typical applications include balance scales, trampolines, garage doors, dock levelers, farm machinery and various types of spring tensioning devices.Dimensions Measurement GuideHold the spring in one hand, and the calipers in the other hand.Place the calipers across the outside coil, either at the end or the center of the spring. This is called the Outside Diameter (O.D.).Place the calipers on the wire at one end of the body coil of the spring. This is called the Wire or Material Size.Place the calipers (or tape measure) on the full length of the spring, inside the hooks. This is called the Length (L.I.H.). (see diagram for example)MaterialsThe highest grades of spring wire are used when fabricating our springs. To create cost-effective warehousing of our stock spring inventory for our customers, we offer material certification as custom springs only. Certifications of conformance for geometric tolerances set by the Spring Manufacturers Institute (SMI) are available for our stock springs upon request.The term "spring steel" is a stock inventory term covering music wire, hard-drawn(MB) wire, and oil-tempered wire. Additionally, our extension spring materials include stainless steel (300/400/600 series), beryllium copper, and phosphor bronze.TolerancesTolerances for extension spring rates depend upon the body-diameter to wire-diameter but are usually +/- 10% and +/- 5% on the diameter. The initial tension is much more difficult to control and is offered as a reference value only.EndsThe ends on our extension springs are the common machine-made hook and full-loop configurations. The hooks or loops may have an across center transition of the last coil before forming the hook or loop. The angle between hook/loop planes (end position) is random. If you need a specific end configuration, it is best to contact our custom spring department.FinishOur extension springs contain a selection of commonly requested finishes:ZincBlack OxidePassivated (upon request)None (can be plated upon request)

Die springs are helical compression springs and are made using round or rectangular metal wire. While the springs were originally designed for use in die sets, they are used in many other applications today. However, they are also well-suited for many applications where high-static or shock-load stresses are required, or when maximum cycle-life is important. Rectangular wire is employed to reduce the solid height and increase the space efficiency of the design. Steel and chrome are examples of the more common materials used for these springs. The designs call for color coating the wires. The color of the coating often indicates the amount of compression the spring is designed to withstand. Depending on the intended usage, the wire may be wound clockwise or counter-clockwise. In some applications, the direction will not matter since the spring’s main function is to provide support for a load. If you are not sure which direction would work best, our team will be happy to help you make a decision based on the direction of the spring you currently have in place.Die Spring CharacteristicsKathysia Industrial has designed and manufactures a complete line of industrial die springs. Generally used in die machinery, they are well-suited for many applications where high-static or shock-load stresses are required or when maximum cycle-life is important.Measuring Die SpringsMeasure the Hole Diameter (also known as Outside Diameter)Measure the Rod Diameter (also known as Inside Diameter)Measure the Free Length (no load on the spring)Measure the Wire Size (both width and thickness dimensions)Use our search feature or catalog to find the correct color code and size for your needs.Hole and Rod DiameterThe die spring containment hole diameter sizes used in our online and print catalogs must be considered to eliminate possible spring-to-wall friction caused by heat, wear due to fabrication tolerances, and interference from the spring diameter growth due to compression. If the spring is long for its diameter, an internal supporting rod may be required to eliminate spring buckling.HeatThermal effects are frequently ignored in spring failure or load-loss analysis. The maximum rated service temperature for chrome-alloy steel is about 440° F. The following table reflects the approximate load losses due to heat that can be expected with die springs.Materials & Service LifeAll of our die springs are fabricated from the most efficient wire cross-section, which is rectangular with rounded corners. The oil-tempered die springs are offered for die sets and general use at a reduced cost. A very long service life may be expected from oil-tempered springs if their maximum deflection is held to about 25% of their length. The highest grade of electrically-furnaced, shot-peened and preset chrome-alloy steel die springs are offered for unsurpassed quality.FinishDie springs of oil-tempered material are available as unfinished only. A color-coding system is employed for our chrome-alloy line for instant visual identification of the spring’s work range and to prevent errors in spring selection and installation. The color coding is a light coating of water-based paint.Chrome Silicon Color CodeFew Load (JFA) – YellowLight Load (JLA)– BlueMedium Load (JMA) – RedHeavy Load (JHA) – GreenBig Load (JBA) – Brown

Kathysia Industrial can produce high-grade, cylindrically-shaped compression springs in the world. A compression spring is an open-coil helical spring that offers resistance to a compressive force applied axially. They are usually coiled at a constant diameter, though they can be coiled in other needed forms such as conical, concave (barrel), convex (hourglass), or various combinations of these. They are typically manufactured from the round wire in a cylindrical shape and are extremely customizable, square, ovate, rectangular and other non-round cross-section wire can be fashioned to meet differing requirements. Compression springs are used to resist force and/or store energy, depending upon the application.CharacteristicsBy far the most widely used type of spring, compression springs are designed to oppose compression and return to its uncompressed length when the applied force is removed. A variable pitch between the coils provides different spring rates throughout the operating range of the spring and aid in minimizing resonate surging and vibration.  Because of the number of compression spring characteristics that can be tailored to specific circumstances, this type of spring represents a flexible design approach to force resistance and energy storage.Dimensions Measurement GuideHold the base of the spring in one hand, and the calipers in the other hand.Place the calipers on the outside of the last coil, measuring the largest dimension. This is called the Outside Diameter (O.D.).Place the calipers on the wire in the center of the spring. This is called the Wire or Material Size. You should also measure the wire toward one end for comparison and accuracy.Place the calipers on the full length of the uncompressed spring. This is called Free Length.Count the total coils, beginning at one end, just next to where the wire has been cut. Be sure you count all coils, including any portion of a coil. (see diagram for example)Service lifeIt should be noted that if critical force-versus-deflection linearity is required, only the center 60-80% of the available deflection range should be employed. Thus, reserve at least the first and last 15-20% of the range for potential spring-end and adjacent coil-contact effects. These effects can be largely ignored for the majority of spring applications.The "Suggest Maximum Deflection" used in our online and print catalog reflects the recommended inches of travel to obtain a statistical service-life of approximately 100,000 cycles(deflections) with infrequent breakage. This can be realized if the spring in question is not subjected to shock loads, rapid cycling, temperature extremes, corrosion, or stress values above those recommended. If the spring is statically loaded (not cycling), a near-infinite life can be expected. Extended spring service-life can be achieved through shot-peening. Our custom spring department can advise you regarding this procedure.MaterialsThe highest grades of spring wire are used when fabricating our springs. To create cost-effective warehousing of our stock spring inventory for our customers, we offer material certification as custom springs only. Certifications of conformance for geometric tolerances set by the Spring Manufacturers Institute (SMI) are available for our stock springs upon request.The term "spring steel" is a stock inventory term covering music wire, hard-drawn(MB) wire, and oil-tempered wire. Additionally, stock compression spring materials may include stainless steel (300 series), beryllium copper, and phosphor bronze.TolerancesKathysia Industrial manufactures the springs to commercial tolerances, as defined by the SMI. Calculated rates and loads based on SMI geometric tolerances have an approximate +/- 10%. Low or high-index springs will have higher values. Compression springs characteristically have an hourglass shape when coiled on an automatic coiler; therefore, outside/inside tolerancing is applied to end coils only. This is an improvement consideration when selecting a spring that fits over a rod or inside a cylinder. Call us if tighter tolerance values are required for your application.Direction of Helix(Wind)The wind direction of our springs varies, both right-hand and left-hand wind. Our springs are usually for right-hand wind direction. To order spring-wound a specific direction, please contact our custom spring division.EndsBoth the online catalog and the print version provide data on end configuration for our compression springs. Available configurations include:Closed (C) – The last coil at each end is bent back to touch the previous coil to create a flat base.Closed and Ground (C&G) – The closed ends of a spring are ground to a more accurate flat base. This also reduces the solid length.Open (O) – The spring end coils remain open, maintaining the spring machine’s helical wind shape.FinishOur compression springs usually with the finish of the spraying plastic, also you can select the following requested finishes:ZincBlack OxidePassivated (upon request)None (can be plated upon request)

Kathysia Industrial is a leading manufacturer of parabolic and conventional leaf springs. The wide product range is suitable for all sorts of vehicles, from small trailer springs to large, heavy-duty and off-road vehicle springs, the lightest utility vehicles to the heaviest trucks, built for long-haul or off-road missions.   Our custom manufactured leaf springs are designed to meet the most precise specifications or tolerances. We take special pride in our high quality standards and service reputation. For more than 60 years we have been supplying our customers with the finest leaf springs.After the rolling and forging operations, the spring leaves are quenched and tempered to achieve the required mechanical properties. They are then shot-peened to increase the fatigue life. Magnetic particle inspection tests are carried out when required.Using a specific process, Kathysia can manufacture high stress springs. The high performances obtained enable a weight reduction and, as a result, allow the vehicle load to be increased.Leaves for multi-leaf springs are prepared by cutting and stamping whilst parabolic leaves are hot rolled in a purpose-made rolling machine. The ends of the main leaf are heated and the eyes are then hot rolled. The leaves are heated and individually bent to the correct arc radius and, whilst still clamped between the bending tool, each leaf is quenched in oil to receive high strength and the correct shape. Parabolic leaves also have an arc radius but are however normally straight in the thicker central section. The leaves are finally tempered for high material toughness and strength.After cooling, the shot peening process is necessary for all parabolic leaves. For multi-leaf springs however, it is normally only the two safety-critical leaves that require shot peening. The bushes are pressed into the eyes and the stack of leaves assembled. Positive stresses are then introduced into the spring by a pre-stressing process.The multi leaf surfaces are protected against corrosion by painting of the outer surfaces and by lubrication between each leaf. Parabolic leaves are individually painted on all surfaces.
