Accopac - Auburn MFG
Accopac
High Performance Sealing Solutions For Die cut Gaskets, Seals, Insulators and Bushings
Introduction:
Cellulose Accopac® from Auburn comprises a family of
gasket materials that combines
cellulose fibers with synthetic rubber binders to produce products whose
chemical resistances are superior to pure cellulose-fiber gasket materials.
These products are ideal for light- to medium-duty applications where
compressible gasket material is required. Cellulose Accopac® products are
pliable, flexible, bendable, and easy to die cut into specific gasket
shapes. Typical usages for Cellulose Accopac® involve die cut gaskets used
for water pumps, marine equipment, gasoline engines, oil seals, dust seals,
shims and bushing applications.
Standard Products:
CS-301 from Auburn has a controlled-swell styrene
butadiene rubber binder. It is intended for use in applications involving
die cut gaskets with water, high analine point oil, and other application
not including aromatic fuels and certain solvents, and with shot duration
maximum temperatures up to 180°C (350°F)
CN-705 from Auburn is a low-density nitrile butadiene bound material that
is suitable for die cut gaskets used with oil, gasoline or water. It is
intened for use in applications with short duration maximum temperatures up
to 180C (350F).
RN-8011 from Auburn is a low-density, cellulose fiber material with high
rubber filler content and a nitrile butadiene rubber binder. It provides
excellent sealability for oil and water at low flange preassures, and is
used for die cut gaskets for engines, transmission pans, water pumps, and
environmental seals. It is intended for applications with short duration
maximum temperatures up to 180°C (350°F). RN-8011 has a
UL component
recognition.
Material Availability:
Cellulose Accopac® is available in many standard
thicknesses - .010", .015", .031", .047", .067" and master rolls that are
40" wide. These products can be further supplied in a variety of forms that
include continuous length roll, sheets, precision strips, slit-to-width
rolls, and custom die cut gaskets.
Manufacturing Method:
Auburn can manufacture a
precision gasket using a number of
production methods. For a very complex part that involves a low quantity
requirement, we ordinarily use a water-jet cutting method as the preferred
choice in order to eliminate the need for a costly tool.
Steel rule die cutting
Water-jet cutting
Rotary die cutting
Kiss-cut die cutting
Quick set-up hydraulic-press die cutting
Prototype or sample lot die cutting
Tooling:
For a simple part such as a plain die cut washer, a disc, a
rectangular pad or a uniform-width strip, a house-tool is very often
available at no additional cost. For a more complex part that requires a
tool, a steel rule die is built. A steel rule die’s cost is usually quite
minimal ($95.00-$125.00 range) and its production time is ordinarily only 1
or 2 days, at which time a first article sample is sent to the customer for
a final approval.
Adhesive Backings:
Auburn is capable of taking any Accopac® material and
applying adhesive
to one or both of its surfaces. Auburn adhesives are available for both raw
materials and finished die cut gaskets including die cut shims, washers,
spacers, gaskets and seals. Auburn works with dozens of popular adhesives
including:
ACR-2 (Double Coated Acrylic Pressure Sensitive Adhesive)
3M Transfer Adhesives
Rubber-Based Pressure Sensitive Adhesives
Repositionable Adhesives
3M VHB Tapes (Very High Bond)
The use of adhesives has many distinct advantges that include eliminating
the messy job of cementing during assembly operations, assuring a uniform
amount of adhesive per part, and reducing labor time in assembly operations.
Ordering Information and Special Orders:
Please contact your Auburn Customer Service Representative to learn
more about these products or to obtain material recommendations, product
samples, design ideas, or price quotations for either raw materials or
custom die cut gaskets.

Thermo-Tork® - Auburn MFG
Thermo-Tork®
High Performance Sealing Solutions For Die cut Gaskets, Seals, Insulators and Bushings
Introduction:
Thermo-Tork® gasket materials
from Auburn outperform many more expensive alternative products in a wide
range of higher temperature, heavy-duty applications. Designed for
use up to 400°C (750°F),
Thermo-Tork® materials are offered with either a Fully Cured or a Latent
Cured Thermally Stable Binder System and are made with Heat-Resisting
Fibers. Thermo-Tork® products are pliable, flexible, bendable, and easy to
die cut into specific gasket shapes. Typical usages of Thermo-Tork® involve
die cut gaskets intended for high pressure and high temperature flange
applications, compressors, small engines, marine equipment and automotive
applications.
Standard Products:
TN-9000
has a fully cured nitrile butadiene rubber binder with Aramid fiber. It has
good tensile strength, low creep relaxation, and excellent fuel and oil
resistance. It is intended for applications that include die cut gaskets
needed for high flange pressures and temperatures and with short duration
maximum temperatures up to 400°C (750°F).
TN-9001
is a heavy-duty latent cure material with nitrile binder. It provides an
excellent source of oil resistant die cut gaskets and is intended for
applications with short duration maximum temperatures up to 400°C (750°F).
TN-9015
is a heavy-duty latent cure material with nitrile binder. It provides an
excellent source of oil resistant die cut gaskets and is intended for
applications with short duration maximum temperatures up to 400°C (750°F).
Material Availability:
Thermo-Tork® is available in many standard thicknesses - .010”,
.015”, .031”, .047”, 062” and master rolls that are 40” wide. These products
can be further supplied in a variety of forms that include continuous length
rolls, sheets, precision strips, slit-to-width rolls and custom die cut
gaskets.
Manufacturing Capabilities:
Auburn’s specialty is fabrication of
precision die cut gaskets with
tight tolerances and clean cut edges for any production quantity from a
single piece up to millions. All die cut gaskets are cleaned, inspected and
neatly packaged prior to shipment.
Manufacturing Method:
Auburn can manufacture a precision gasket using a number of
production methods. For a very complex part that involves a low quantity
requirement, we ordinarily use a water-jet cutting method as the preferred
choice in order to eliminate the need for a costly tool.
Steel rule die cutting
Water-jet cutting
Rotary die cutting
Kiss-cut die cutting
Quick set-up hydraulic-press die cutting
Prototype or sample lot die cutting
Tooling:
For a simple part such as a plain die cut washer, a disc, a
rectangular pad or a uniform-width strip, a house-tool is very often
available at no additional cost. For a more complex part that requires a
tool, a steel rule die is built. A steel rule die’s cost is usually quite
minimal ($95.00-$125.00 range) and its production time is ordinarily only 1
or 2 days, at which time a first article sample is sent to the customer for
a final approval.
Adhesive Backings:
Auburn is capable of taking any  Thermo-Tork® material and
apply adhesive
to one or both sides of its surfaces. Auburn adhesives are available for both raw
materials and finished die cut gaskets including die cut shims, washers,
spacers, gaskets and seals. Auburn works with dozens of popular adhesives
including:
ACR-2 (Double Coated Acrylic Pressure Sensitive Adhesive)
3M Transfer Adhesives
Rubber-Based Pressure Sensitive Adhesives
Repositionable Adhesives
3M VHB Tapes (Very High Bond)
The use of adhesives has many distinct advantages that include eliminating
the messy job of cementing during assembly operations, assuring a uniform
amount of adhesive per part, and reducing labor time in assembly operations.
Ordering Information and Special Orders:
Please contact your Auburn Customer Service Representative to learn
more about these products or to obtain material recommendations, product
samples, design ideas, or price quotations for either raw materials or
custom die cut gaskets.

FIBERGLASS REINFORCED SOLID SILICONE
PRODUCTS
Introduction
Fiberglass-Reinforced Solid Silicone Rubber from Auburn is a
dimensionally-stable, durable gasket material that is commonly used for
press pads, belting and gasketing. It is available in six unique
constructions, each of which is described below.
FRF3320, available in
three thicknesses, is designed to meet AMS 3320. Consequently, 3320 has
lubricating oil resistance and excellent compression set resistance.
FR4032 and
FR4050 are thin, flexible
and abrasion-resistant fiberglass-reinforced gasket materials intended
for general purpose use.
FR4420 is a specially
formulated for thermal stability and long life under extreme heat and
pressure and extended dwell times. It resists reversion (i.e. softening
and outgassing) longer than general purpose silicone. Throughout its
useful life, 4420 has thermal stability for consistent thermal
conductivity.
FR4444 has specially
formulated rubber compound to give better reversion resistance. The
reinforcement is a special crush-resistant fiberglass, making the
product excellent for press pads in high-temperature and pressure
lamination applications.
FR4451 is a fiberglass
fabric coated with static dissipating silicone rubber having a surface
resistivity of 1 x 10 ohms-cm. This product virtually eliminates static
electric discharges which cause operator discomfort and can potentially
damage electrical laminates.
FR4480 utilizes the most
reversion-resistant silicone rubber compound. This material is designed
for use in applications involving the tough combination of prolonged
high-pressure confinement with temperatures in the range of 375° F to
650° F.
Adhesive Backings:
Auburn can apply pressure sensitive silicone or acrylic adhesives to FR standard sheets
(36" x 36" or 24" x 24") or continuous length rolls at 36" wide. Sheet
thickness will be 1/32" thick or more. The self-adhering materials
permit substantial savings because they are easy to apply, simplify
production, and eliminate the high cost of bonding.
SP-2021 Silicone Adhesive
withstands the same temperature extremes, -100° F to +500°
F, as the
silicone rubber sheet.
AP-2022 Acrylic adhesive,
whose temperature range is -40° F to +300° F, offers the advantage of twice
the adhesion to steel and a longer shelf life than regular silicone adhesive.
Hi-Temp Acrylic Adhesive, newly released, is capable of
withstanding temperature of 450° F, while providing the high-bonding
strength of acrylic adhesive.  All of these above-mentioned
FR Fiberglass-Reinforced Solid Silicone Rubber materials are readily
available either plain or with an adhesive affixed to one or both sides.
Self-adhering adhesive-backed sheets are protected by an easy-to-remove
peel-off liner for application to a clean, dry, degreased surface.
Product Advantages:
High Temperature Resistance to +500° F
Low Temperature Flexibility to -100° F
Compression Set & Crush Resistance
Little or No Out-Gassing
Excellent Dimensional Stability
Non-Stick Surface, Odorless, Tasteless
Long Service Life
Fungus & Bacteria Resistant

Impervapac - Auburn MFG
Impervapac®
High Performance Sealing Solutions For Die cut Gaskets, Seals, Insulators and Bushings
Introduction:
Impervapac® gasket material from Auburn offers a superior
alternative to rubber gaskets and cork-rubber gaskets in low flange pressure
applications and low internal pressure applications. A unique fiber
composition with high rubber content makes Impervapac® an ideal choice for
sealing gases and fluids, while permitting reduced thickness for additional
economy. Impervapac® is pliable, flexible, bendable, and easy to die cut
into specific gasket shapes. Some of its typical usages involve die cut
gaskets for water pumps, marine equipment, automobile engines, aftermarket
gaskets, gasoline engines, oil seals, dust seals, and basic shim/spacer
applications.
Standard Products:
N-8051 is a light-duty material intended for use with
die cut gasket that involve low internal pressure and reduced flange
pressure up to 13.8 Mpa (2000 psi). It has a nitrile binder for resistance
to oil and is intended for applications with short duration maximum
temperatures up to 180°C (350°F).
Material Availability:
Impervapac® is available
in many standard thicknesses - .010”, .015”, .031”, .047”, 062” and master
rolls that are 40” wide. These products can be further supplied in a variety
of forms that include continuous length rolls, sheets, precision strips,
slit-to-width rolls and custom die cut gaskets.
Manufacturing Capabilities:
Auburn’s specialty is fabrication of
precision die cut gaskets with
tight tolerances and clean cut edges for any production quantity from a
single piece up to millions. All die cut gaskets are cleaned, inspected and
neatly packaged prior to shipment.
Manufacturing Method:
Auburn can manufacture a precision gasket using a number of
production methods. For a very complex part that involves a low quantity
requirement, we ordinarily use a water-jet cutting method as the preferred
choice in order to eliminate the need for a costly tool.
Steel rule die cutting
Water-jet cutting
Rotary die cutting
Kiss-cut die cutting
Quick set-up hydraulic-press die cutting
Prototype or sample lot die cutting
Tooling:
For a simple part such as a plain die cut washer, a disc, a
rectangular pad or a uniform-width strip, a house-tool is very often
available at no additional cost. For a more complex part that requires a
tool, a steel rule die is built. A steel rule die’s cost is usually quite
minimal ($95.00-$125.00 range) and its production time is ordinarily only 1
or 2 days, at which time a first article sample is sent to the customer for
a final approval.
Adhesive Backings:
Auburn is capable of taking any  Impervapac® material and
applying adhesive
to one or both sides of its surfaces. Auburn adhesives are available for both raw
materials and finished die cut gaskets including die cut shims, washers,
spacers, gaskets and seals. Auburn works with dozens of popular adhesives
including:
ACR-2 (Double Coated Acrylic Pressure Sensitive Adhesive)
3M Transfer Adhesives
Rubber-Based Pressure Sensitive Adhesives
Repositionable Adhesives
3M VHB Tapes (Very High Bond)
The use of adhesives has many distinct advantges that include eliminating
the messy job of cementing during assembly operations, assuring a uniform
amount of adhesive per part, and reducing labor time in assembly operations.
Ordering Information and Special Orders:
Please contact your Auburn Customer Service Representative to learn
more about these products or to obtain material recommendations, product
samples, design ideas, or price quotations for either raw materials or
custom die cut gaskets.

Economical Sealing Solutions Line - Auburn MFG
Economical Sealing Solutions Line
High Performance Sealing Solutions For Die cut Gaskets, Seals, Insulators and Bushings
Introduction:
Auburn's Economical Sealing Solutions Line® of
Gasket Materials offers an excellent alternative to other non-asbestos and
asbestos-containing products. These gasketing materials are pliable,
flexible, bendable, and easy to die cut into specific shapes. Typical usages
include die cut gaskets for pumps, filters, flanges, small engines, marine
equipment, dust seals, spacers, shims, gear boxes, and transmissions.
Standard Products:
2231 from Auburn is an environmentally compatible,
low-density, gasket material formulated from recycled gasket materials. It
has an added styrene rubber binder, and is an excellent choice for die cut
gaskets required for general, light-duty applications with short duration
maximum temperatures up to 180°C (350°F).
NI-2085 from
Auburn has a nitrile butadiene rubber binder for
resistance to water, coolant, oil and fuel. It has excellent strength and
sealability characteristics for is used for die cut gaskets, and is intended
for applications with short duration maximum temperatures up to 190°C
(375°F). NI-2085 has UL component recognition.
NV-512 is a cellulose fiber material with a fully cured
nitrile butadiene rubber binder for increased strength and fluid resistance.
It has a very high tensile strength and crush resistance, as is used for die
cut gaskets in air pumps, carburetors, gear boxes and transmissions. It is
intended for applications with short duration maximum temperatures up to
180°C (355°F).
Material Availability:
Auburn’s Economical Sealing Solutions® Line of product are
available in many standard thicknesses - .010”, .015”, .031”, .047”, 062”
and master rolls that are 40” wide. These products can be further supplied
in a variety of forms that include continuous length rolls, sheets,
precision strips, slit-to-width rolls and custom die cut gaskets.
Manufacturing Capabilities:
Auburn’s specialty is fabrication of
precision die cut gaskets  with
tight tolerances and clean cut edges for any production quantity from a
single piece up to millions. All die cut gaskets are cleaned, inspected and
neatly packaged prior to shipment.
Manufacturing Method:
Auburn can manufacture a precision gasket using a number of
production methods. For a very complex part that involves a low quantity
requirement, we ordinarily use a water-jet cutting method as the preferred
choice in order to eliminate the need for a costly tool.
Steel rule die cutting
Water-jet cutting
Rotary die cutting
Kiss-cut die cutting
Quick set-up hydraulic-press die cutting
Prototype or sample lot die cutting
Tooling:
For a simple part such as a plain die cut washer, a disc, a
rectangular pad or a uniform-width strip, a house-tool is very often
available at no additional cost. For a more complex part that requires a
tool, a steel rule die is built. A steel rule die’s cost is usually quite
minimal ($95.00-$125.00 range) and its production time is ordinarily only 1
or 2 days, at which time a first article sample is sent to the customer for
a final approval.
Adhesive Backings:
Auburn is capable of taking any
economical sealing gasket material and
applying adhesive to one or both of its
surfaces. Auburn adhesives are available for both raw materials and finished
die cut gaskets including die cut shims, washers, spacers, gaskets and
seals. Auburn works with dozens of popular adhesives including:
ACR-2 (Double Coated Acrylic Pressure Sensitive Adhesive)
3M Transfer Adhesives
Rubber-Based Pressure Sensitive Adhesives
Repositionable Adhesives
3M VHB Tapes (Very High Bond)
The use of adhesives has many distinct advantages that include
eliminating the messy job of cementing during assembly operations, assuring
a uniform amount of adhesive per part, and reducing labor time in assembly
operations.
Ordering Information and Special Orders:
Please contact your Auburn Customer Service Representative to learn
more about these products or to obtain material recommendations, product
samples, design ideas, or price quotations for either raw materials or
custom die cut gaskets.

THERMALLY AND ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE SILICONE
PRODUCTS
Introduction
Saint GobainTM Conductive Silicones from Auburn represent
a real technological breakthrough that expands the use of silicone
gasketing into the electronic assembly market. By adding special
fillers to silicone, the following products have been developed to
be either thermally or electrically conductive and applications that
were once off-limits to silicone can now be re-evaluated for its
use.
TF1818 is a smooth, calender-coated silicone
product that offers great conformability, cut-through resistance and
dielectric strength while maintaining a low level of thermal
resistance.
TF1867,
1869,
1877,
1879 and
FURO 400 SERIES are thermally - conductive
silicone coated fabrics that provide thin, cost-effective heat
transfer capability. All are obtained plain or with
thermally-conductive pressure-sensitive adhesive on one side.
TC100 is an unsupported, thermally-conductive
solid silicone available in several thicknesses, providing thermal
and mechanical protection to electronic devices.
TC100U, in the uncured state, is an effective
system for bonding printed circuit boards, heat sinks, and
electronic components to a variety of substrates. Refrigerated
storage is required.
EC102 is an electrically-conductive, 50
durometer solid silicone rubber that performs three distinct
functions. The carbon filler in it allows it to act as a low
amperage conductor. It shields RF and EM interference. And it
protects against the development of electrostatic discharge.
Adhesive Backings:
Auburn can apply pressure sensitive silicone or acrylic adhesives to
standard sheets
(36" x 36" or 24" x 24") or continuous length rolls at 36° wide. The
self-adhering materials permit substantial savings because they are
easy to apply, simplify production, and eliminate the high cost of
bonding.
SP-2021
Silicone Adhesive withstands the same temperature
extremes, -100°
F to +500° F, as the silicone rubber sheet.
AP-2022 Acrylic
adhesive, whose temperature range is -40°
F to +300°F, offers the same advantage of twice the
adhesion to steel and a longer shelf life than silicone adhesive.
Hi-Temp Acrylic Adhesive, newly released, is
capable of withstanding temperature of 450F, while providing the
high-bonding strength of acrylic adhesive. All of these
above-mentioned electrically or thermally conductive silicones from
Auburn are readily available either plain or with an adhesive
backing applied to one, or in some cases, both sides. Self-adhering
adhesive-backed sheets are protected by an easy-to-remove peel-off
liner for application to a clean, dry, degreased surface.
Product Advantages:
High Temperature Resistance to +500° F
Low Temperature Flexibility to -100° F
Resistant to Compression Set
Little or No Out-Gassing Materials
Non-Corrosive, Non-Toxic
Non-Stick Surface, Odorless, Tasteless
Long Service Life
Resistant to Growth of Fungus & Bacteria
Resistant to Ozone

PORON® FOAM (MICROCELLULAR POLYURETHANE)
Introduction
Poron® micro-cellular polyurethane foams offer a broad range of design advantages for those engineers who are involved with gasketing, sealing, energy absorbtion or
cushion-gasket applications.
Poron® Foams have excellent compression-set resistance and high resilience, providing a gasketing seal that won't break down over extended use.
Poron® foams are conformable and flexible even under extreme environmental conditions.
Poron® is low out gassing and flame retardant (UL-Listed).
Poron® is significantly less expensive than silicone and can replace silicone in many applications in which a low-compression set, low out-gassing, and flame retardant material is required.
Poron® foams are exceptionally easy to die-cut or water-jet cut. The surface of
Poron® is smooth, cosmetically appealing and ideal for having adhesives applied. Typical applications for
Poron® include; cellular telephone gasketing, electrical enclosures, electronic gasketing, vibration damping, cushioning pads, acoustical control gasketing and automotive gasketing.
Standard Products and Adhesive Backings (Optional)
Our general purpose Poron® Foam (Microcellular Polyurethane) is available in four grades of compressibility, determined by compression deflection.
Poron® 4701-30 is very soft, easily compressed and often used where flexibility is a key requirement.
Poron® 4701-40 is soft and good for use in a wide variety of applications.
Poron® 4701-50, firm grade, is often used in applications where there is a substantial amount of energy to be absorbed.
Poron® 4701-60 is very firm like solid rubber and can withstand much greater compressive force than ordinary foam. Two additional Poron® Foams are now available from Auburn.
Poron® 4790-92 is extra soft, slow rebound foam with the lowest closure force of any Poron®.
Poron® 4701-41 has a closed-cell foam structure and is designed to provide enhanced sealability. Vacuum-enclosure applications, for example, will require this material.
All Poron® Foam is now available with or without adhesive.
Auburn's adhesive backings can be applied to one or both sides.
Product Benefits:
• 	Excellent compression set resistance which enables durable, long-term
performance for gasketing, sealing, and cushioning.
• 	Low-outgassing and non-fogging, containing no plasticizers or residual
chemicals to contaminate the device. The material will not become brittle
and crumble and is non-corrosive to metal.
• Inherently flame retardant without the use of additives. Many of the
materials meet flammability requirements of
UL HBF and MVSS 302.
• Engineered urethane formulations offering a wide modulus range - 2-90
psi
@ 25% deflection - for more design versatility requirements.
• Excellent performance over broad temperature range (-40®C to 90®C) with
good chemical resistance.
• Easy to fabricate, die-cuts cleanly, and readily accepts adhesive without
surface preparation. Available in a variety of colors.
Ordering Information & Special Orders
Auburn can die-cut, water-jet cut, slit to width, laminate and apply adhesive
to all Poron® Foam products. Auburn can supply Poron® in
sheets, rolls or custom parts. All Poron® Foams can be supplied either plain (no adhesive) or with an
adhesive backing applied to one or both sides. For additional technical assistance,
material recommendations, samples and/or price quotations, please contact your

Auburn
cork-rubber gasket material offers many of the
advantages of synthetic rubber compounds, with the important
additional property of controlled compressibility. Thus
cork-Rubber gasket material can often by used in place of
straight rubber in applications where the tendency of straight
rubber to side flow would be objectionable. Auburn offers a
group of 20 different cork-rubber gasket materials with a wide
range of firmnesses, hardnesses, thicknesses, colors and
densities. Cork-rubber gasket material is resistant to oil, fuel
and other solvents; can readily accept
adhesive backings,
is cosmetically appealing, and is easy to die cut in specific
shapes.
