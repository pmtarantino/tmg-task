BriskHeat was founded by retired two Star Major General Earnest Briscoe
Core Technology: Knitted and Braided Heating Element
On December 1, 1949, BriskHeat® was founded by retired Two Star Major General Earnest Briscoe in Columbus, Ohio by borrowing against a $300 insurance policy. BriskHeat started its humble beginnings as the Briscoe Manufacturing Company making airplane wing de-icers for the military and its now famous multi-stranded and serpentine wound knitted and braided heating element. The knitted and braided heating element is still used in most of BriskHeat’s products today due to its superior durability, flexibility, and temperature uniformity.
Major Product Line Expansion and New Location
Cloth Heating Jackets (1950) Silicone Rubber Extruded Heating Blankets (1957)
In 1952, BriskHeat moved to 1055 Gibbard Ave in Columbus, Ohio which served as its primary manufacturing location and corporate headquarters for 64 years until 2016. During this time there was major expansion of product lines including the first cloth heating jacket introduced in 1950 and silicone rubber extruded heating tapes and blankets in 1957.
We were known as“Briskeat” before BriskHeat
From the 1950’s through 1981, BriskHeat products were sold under the name “Briskeat”. Through the 1960’s, BriskHeat was working hard to support several different industries including aerospace.
Busy decade of innovation
Laboratory Heating Products Catalog (1977) Heating Cable (1972)
1970 to 1979 was the decade of innovation for BriskHeat. Product lines continued to expand with PTFE and Silicone coating on products, Heating Cable and percentage controllers were added along with the creation of silicone rubber drum heaters and the ACR Hot Bonder to futher support the aviation and aerospace industries. With the expansion and growth of products across the board, the 1970s were a turning point for BriskHeat.
Drum Heaters (1977) ACR® Hot Bonder (1977)
The BriskHeat name was born
In 1984, the company changed its name to BriskHeat. This is the name we are now known for around the world.
Grounded Heating Element Patent and The Rise of Semiconductor
BriskHeat received a patent for its grounded heating element in 1999. This heating element is found in the majority of BriskHeat products. In addiiton, the 90's saw the rapid rise of Semiconductor and growth of the PC. With this rise, came the increased need for BriskHeat cloth heating jackets to prevent build-up in gas lines, exhaust lines, and forelines. BriskHeat has been a major participant in the Semiconductor industry since its beginning.
Major growth and expansion
The 2000's was a time of major growth and expansion. During this time, BriskHeat released its Centipede® Temperature Control System, Wrap-around IBC/Tote Tank Heaters, and HSTAT Silicone Rubber Heating Tape with Adjustable Thermostat Control. In 2008, BriskHeat began taking orders online. BriskHeat also opened a second cloth production facility in Columbus, Ohio to help support the rapid increase in Cloth Heating Jacket demand.
BriskHeat Today
BriskHeat now has locations around the world to support our global customer base including production in both U.S. and Vietnam, sales offices in Taiwan, China, Germany, and France, and warehouse locations in China and Netherlands. In 2016, after 67 years at its Gibbard Ave location in Columbus, OH, BriskHeat moved to a much larger and upgraded facility at 4800 Hilton Corporate Drive.

Ampere (Amp) - Unit of current (flow) (l)=E/R
AC - Alternating current.
Ampacity - The current-carrying capacity of the conductor under stated thermal conditions.*
Conductor - A conductor is the current-carrying, non-heat producing component of a heating element.*
Conduction - The transfer of energy within or between two bodies in physical contact.
Convection - The movement of a mass with its associated energy (liquid or gas) from one location to another.
DC - Direct Current.
Dielectric Breakdown -The ability of the electrical insulation to withstand an applied voltage
Element - An element is a resistor encased in an acceptable insulating material covered with a protective sheath.
Ground - A conducting connection between an electrical circuit or equipment and the earth or some conducting body that serves in place of the earth.*
Hazardous Location - Locations are classified depending on the properties of the flammable vapors, or gases, or combustible dusts, or fibers which may be present and the likelihood that a flammable or combustible concentration or quantity is present.*
Heat - Heat is energy in transition, or transfer, from one body to another by virtue of temperature difference existing between the bodies.
Heater - A heater is a completed, usable assembly containing one or more elements.
Heat of Fusion - Heat necessary to change solid to liquid.
Heat of Vaporization - Heat necessary to change solid to gas.
Hertz - Unit of frequency of charge reversal for alternating current.
Hi-Pot - A high voltage quality assurance test performed on electrical components and systems.
Impedance Heat - A system in which heat is generated in a pipeline or vessel wall by causing current to flow through the pipeline or vessel wall by direct connection to an AC voltage source from a dual-winding transformer.
Insulation - Electrical insulation is the dielectric material surrounding the resistor and/or conductor in order to electrically isolate the current-carrying components from ground or other components.* Thermal insulation is any material that retards the transfer of heat to the environment or other components.
Insulation Resistance - Insulation resistance is the ability of the insulation to resist the percentage of current.*
Leakage - The undesirable passage of current flow through or over the surface of an Insulator.
Leakage Current - The total electrical current flow from the resistor through or around the insulation to a point external to the resistor when the element is energized.*
OHM - The electrical unit of resistance (R) R=E/I
Parallel Circuit - A circuit in which the identical voltage is presented to all components and the components according to the resistance or the impedance of components.
Radiation - The transfer of energy from one body to another through space by electromagnetic wave phenomena.
Rating - Rating is the performance characteristic of an element or heater and is normally expressed in power output (watts) for a specific input voltage.
Resistor - A resistor is the heat-producing component of an element.*
Series Circuit - A circuit in which the components are arranged end to end to form a single path for current.
Single Phase - A system energized from a single alternating voltage.
Specific Heat - The heat energy in Btu's required to change the temperature of one pound of a substance by 1°F.
Specific Gravity (Gas) - The ratio of the density of a gas to the density of water at 60°F and 14.7 PSIA.
Specific Gravity (Liquid) - The ratio of the density of a liquid to the density of water at 60°F and 14.7 PSIA.
Thermal Resistance - The property that opposes the flow of heat (energy) through the material.
Terminal -A terminal is the device or point at which external power is connected.*
Three Phase - A system energized from three substantially equal voltages that differ in phase by one-third cycle or 120°.
Voltage (Volt) - Unit of electrical pressure. 1 volt is the amount of pressure that cause one ampere of current under a pressure of one volt. (W) W=EI
Wattage (Watt) - Unit of electrical power. One watt is equivalent to the power represented by one ampere of current under a pressure of one volt.
Watt Density - Watt density is the output of the element or the resistor in watts per square inch of surface. On heating cable elements, watt density is expressed in watts per foot of cable.*
Wattage Rating Tolerance - Wattage output tolerance is the acceptable manufacturer's wattage variation allowed from rated wattage at rated voltage.*
*NEMA Standard

What BriskHeat Customers Are Saying
“I have been purchasing BriskHeat products for several years to meet our company’s heat tracing needs. They specify the necessary products to meet my particular need, whether it’s a heating pad application to keep our equipment hot, a heat trace application to keep fat from setting up in the supply lines, or for freeze protection for our hot water recirculation system. These items have always worked as promised and I can get them quickly, with the items generally being in stock. BriskHeat is the first place I call when I have a need for any type of heat tracing.”
Bret Marquis(Project Engineer with Pro-Pet LLC)
“Right from the start, I was impressed with BriskHeat. They are a company with exceptional customer service. We order materials and they arrive on time. If we ever have any questions, there is always someone on the other end of the line who can answer them for us immediately.

This is the type of partner relationship we strive to develop to ensure our customers receive the best final product we can produce.”

Tips for Heater and Temperature Control Equipment Used in Cannabis Processing
April 21, 2020 3:09:01 PM EDT by Edye Buchanan
Currently in the U.S., there are 34 states which have legalized medicinal cannabis use with an additional six (6) states allowing cannabidiol (CBD) derived from cannabis.

Globally, there are more than 50 countries which have legalized some variation of medical cannabis use. Many have restrictions on acceptable levels of THC due to its intoxicating properties.

What Our Customers Are Saying
"I have been purchasing BriskHeat products for several years to meet our company’s heat tracing needs. They specify the necessary products to meet my particular need, whether it’s a heating pad application to keep our equipment hot, a heat trace application to keep fat from setting up in the supply lines, or for freeze protection for our hot water recirculation system. These items have always worked as promised and I can get them quickly, with the items generally being in stock. BriskHeat is the first place I call when I have a need for any type of heat tracing."
Bret Marquis, Project Engineer with Pro-Pet LLC
"Right from the start, I was impressed with BriskHeat. They are a company with exceptional customer service. We order materials and they arrive on time. If we ever have any questions, there is always someone on the other end of the line who can answer them for us immediately. BriskHeat offers us a well-made high-quality product that does the job perfectly. This is the type of partner relationship we strive to develop to ensure our customers receive the best final product we can produce."
Robert Ferguson, Project Manager with International Flora Technologies
"We have installed tens of thousands of feet of BriskHeat’s self-limiting electric heat trace cable all over the country, in every climate imaginable. BriskHeat’s product has never let us down, not one failure!"
Todd Goldsmith, Chief Operating Officer with Liquid Systems
"Edwards Fiberglass Inc. has had the pleasure to work [with] BriskHeat for at least the last 15 years. Briskheat has shown exceptional knowledge in their products, availability when need be for conference call etc. and pricing is very competitive. BriskHeat also stands behind their product 100%."
Shane Edwards, President/CEO of Edwards Fiberglass
"BriskHeat, I’m very satisfied with your product. It works great. And very pleased with the service."
Ezra Estep, Lab Technician with Asphalt Emulsions
"We have used BriskHeat Corporation for the past 20 to 25 years. We have always received excellent support from BriskHeat, including delivery and technical support. BriskHeat Corporation is a good company, and I recommend it highly for any heating applications."
Bob Edwards, Owner of Edwards FRP
"We use [BriskHeat] Self-Regulating Heat Cable in our product in all 50 U.S. states and Canada. We use this cable to protect our customers’ equipment from being damaged from ice. We have used this cable for the last 5 years and have never had a cable failure on anything we have use it on. We are very happy with this product and will continue to use it in our applications."
Larry Lehmann, Operation Supervisor with Chillrite
"We use several different types of BriskHeat resistance wire. Each of our designs are specific to each customer, each job, and the engineering group at BriskHeat always helps us with getting the correct insulating factors and resistances necessary for them all. Our heaters are known for their reliability and craftsmanship and it helps when you start with reliable products."
Drew, Bering Manufacturing and Design
"I appreciate your firm’s attention to detail and excellent customer service. It is rare to find a group of people who can anticipate from the shipping information that there is a real time component, and act on that understanding to meet their customer’s needs."
Bill Robertson
"Precise heater jacket construction and construction options offered by BriskHeat results in fast and accurate installation, reduced manpower and schedule demands, and improved heating system reliability."
Dan Weiss,  Senior Engineer of Brookhaven National Laboratory
"We use BriskHeat silicone rubber heating blankets in a variety of custom sizes to heat several of our production wax tanks. They are easily installed, easily maintained, and last a reasonably long time."
Keith Weller,  Site Supervisor with Desert Whale Jojoba/Lip Chemicals
"Oilfield Instrumentation is very pleased with the BriskHeat Heat Tape SL Cable. We use this particular product in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Dakota where the temperatures are freezing this time of year. We have tried other products but they are not as reliable as the BriskHeat product."
Morris Boudreaux,  Procurement Manager with Oilfield Instruments

Conflict Mineral Policy
In Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act the US Conflict Minerals Law was created. This law contains requirements upon SEC listed companies to comply with a commitment to avoid Conflict Minerals in their products. This is more specifically regulating the use of materials that might come from the Great Lakes Region of Africa, primarily material from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This US Law came from international concern regarding mining operations controlled by warring militias in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries (collectively, the “DRC”) who are financing armed conflict with profits from these mines. The Law is part of an effort to curb violence in the DRC. The “conflict minerals” include Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten and Gold “3TG” and their derivatives, used in electronics and many other products. The Act defines these as “conflict minerals” regardless of the geographic origin of the minerals and whether or not they fund armed conflict. As specified under the Act, SEC listed companies whose products contain conflict minerals must make specialized disclosures and conduct related supply chain diligence.
BriskHeat Corporation does not source directly from smelters or mines, but we are surveying our global supply chain to help assure that products supplied to BriskHeat Corporation are Conflict-free.
BriskHeat supports the idea of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI) List of Compliant Smelters, and CFSI’s Conflict-Free Smelter Program, which uses independent third-party audits to identify smelters with systems in place to assure sourcing of only DRC conflict-free materials.
BriskHeat Corporation supports the basic aim of the Conflict Minerals legislation that human rights violations are unacceptable.
In case of further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Marine
The Marine Industry can benefit from BriskHeat’s composite curing/process temperature maintenance solutions, such as hot bonders and silicone rubber heating blankets. The hot bonders and heating blankets allow for fast and easy composite repair/strengthening of damaged composite pieces with BriskHeat’s out-of-autoclave solutions. Using the easily transportable ACR® series hot bonders and a properly sized silicone heating blanket, these repairs can be made on-site without having to ship out pieces for repair. Freeze protection can also be an area of concern for boats and ships. Easily protect and prevent freezing by using BriskHeat’s self-regulating heating cable and silicone rubber heating blankets.
Applications
Composite Curing Marine/Watercraft Repair
The multi-million dollar yacht industry is utilizing composite materials to build monolithic-one piece hulls for their most demanding boat designs. The one-piece hull requires curing and post curing of resins while under vacuum. These structures cannot be easily put into an oven for curing due to their size and weight.

Freeze Protection
Cold temperatures can often damage or destroy objects and their contents.  Pipes, valves, tanks, vessels, conveyers, and housings are examples of common objects that can be hurt by the cold.  BriskHeat flexible surface heating products wrap around these items to protect them in even the most extreme conditions.
